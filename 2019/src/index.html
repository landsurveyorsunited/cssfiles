      <p>üëã Hey! Since 2007, we've been trying to make Land Surveyors United the most useful and fun social surveying platform for Professional Land Surveyors, Students and Educators as we can.</p>
        
      <p>Over time, we have outgrown 2 platforms and this past year we migrated the entire platform to our new home and for the rest of time.  We've built loads of features in the new platform <a href="https://landsurveyorsunited.com/new-site" target="_blank">like these</a> for our users. Let's take a look at some of the features we built for you <strong>just in 2019.</strong></p>
      
      <p>But nothing compares to the incredible things <a href="https://landsurveyorsunited.com/roadmap" target="_blank">we have planned for 2020</a> üòâ.(Roadmap coming Dec. 23rd)</p>

Your associations with other surveyors are still there as well.
