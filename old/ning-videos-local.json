The total station is an electronic theodolite (transit) integrated with an electronic distance measurement (EDM) to read slope distances from the instrument to a particular point, and an on-board computer to collect data and perform advanced coordinate based calculations.[1]\n\nRobotic total stations allow the operator to control the instrument from a distance via remote control. This eliminates the need for an assistant staff member as the operator holds the retroreflector and controls the total station from the observed point.\nAngle measurement\n\nMost total station instruments measure angles by means of electro-optical scanning of extremely precise digital bar-codes etched on rotating glass cylinders or discs within the instrument. The best quality total stations are capable of measuring angles to 0.5 arc-second. Inexpensive \"construction grade\" total stations can generally measure angles to 5 or 10 arc-seconds.\nDistance measurement\nMain article: Distance measurement\n\nMeasurement of distance is accomplished with a modulated infrared carrier signal, generated by a small solid-state emitter within the instrument's optical path, and reflected by a prism reflector or the object under survey. The modulation pattern in the returning signal is read and interpreted by the computer in the total station. The distance is determined by emitting and receiving multiple frequencies, and determining the integer number of wavelengths to the target for each frequency. Most total stations use purpose-built glass corner cube prism reflectors for the EDM signal. A typical total station can measure distances with an accuracy of about 1.5 millimeters (0.0049 ft) + 2 parts per million over a distance of up to 1,500 meters (4,900 ft).[2]\n\nReflectorless total stations can measure distances to any object that is reasonably light in color, up to a few hundred meters.\nCoordinate measurement\n\nThe coordinates of an unknown point relative to a known coordinate can be determined using the total station as long as a direct line of sight can be established between the two points. Angles and distances are measured from the total station to points under survey, and the coordinates (X, Y, and Z or easting, northing and elevation) of surveyed points relative to the total station position are calculated using trigonometry and triangulation. To determine an absolute location a Total Station requires line of sight observations and can be set up over a known point or with line of sight to 2 or more points with known location, called Resection (Free Stationing).[3][4]\n\nFor this reason, some total stations also have a Global Navigation Satellite System receiver and do not require a direct line of sight to determine coordinates. However, GNSS measurements may require longer occupation periods and offer relatively poor accuracy in the vertical axis.[3]\nSurveying or land surveying is the technique, profession, and science of determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional positions of points and the distances and angles between them. A land surveying professional is called a land surveyor. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for ownership, locations, such as building corners or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales.\n\nSurveyors work with elements of geometry, trigonometry, regression analysis, physics, engineering, metrology, programming languages, and the law. They use equipment, such as total stations, robotic total stations, GPS receivers, retroreflectors, 3D scanners, radios, handheld tablets, digital levels, subsurface locators, drones, GIS, and surveying software.\n\nSurveying has been an element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history.

One of the common problems I encountered was the fact that it was really hard to locate some of these vacant land properties.\n\nIf you're a land investor, you probably know what I'm talking about because it is VERY common for vacant land properties to exist without a physical mailing address.\n\nNo street name. No address number. Nothing.\n\nSo where did this leave me? If I couldn't plug a street address into a mapping service like Google Maps - how was I supposed to find where the property was located? This was a serious obstacle because if I didn't know where a property was located, what it looked like, the shape of the parcel, the size of the property or what it's surroundings are - how was I supposed to know what it was worth and make an offer??\n\nI eventually learned that there was always an answer on where a property is located. It was just a matter of whether I knew how to find it.\n\nThe vast majority of counties in the U.S. have what's called a Geographic Information System (GIS). These systems usually aren't user-friendly to work with, but if you care enough to go through the trouble of learning how it works - it can be a MAJOR help.\n\nThis information tends to be quite reliable and will give you data like:\n\n- Property Sizes\n- Property Dimensions\n- Property Ownership\n- Precise Property Locations\n- Property Assessed Values\n- Etc...\n\nEach county's system is a little bit different and it takes some time to figure each one out - but it is absolutely worth the trouble.","createdDate":"2018-05-31T20:52:20.404Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-13T19:14:43.201Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KSai6Rt06c0?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:427047","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"How to Read a Plat or Survey","description":"This is a quick description of some of the items you might see on a property plat or survey.

Have you been following all of the surveying photos and videos submitted from around the planet? No need to wonder why.. just look at what we are doing together here on Land Surveyors United. Stand up and represent your area of the world by introducing yourself in Groups for practically every inch of the earth! What we are building is a comprehensive network for educating those new to surveying about both the similarities and differences shared between surveyors around the world based on locations, which we all know carry different guidelines and rules. Tell us stories about your surveying experiences where you live and enjoy reading the stories of others who live elsewhere, but face similar professional challenges.

It is the one instrument that can perform the bulk of the survey tasks on the construction project. The total station utilizes an electronic signal to shoot targets (prisms), in-conjunction with a microcomputer inside the instrument that performs calculations with the data from the EDM (Electronic Distance Measurement). Total Stations can provide horizontal measurements, vertical measurements, horizontal angles and vertical angles and many other functions.\n\nThis video will illustrate how to set up the Total Station, by following industry standard ways to do so. It is imperative that accurate, stable and efficient set up techniques be followed when first using a total station. This will ensure efficient and accurate layout every time.\n\nCommon uses of the total station include performing a traverse on a group of points (primary or secondary control), layout of points (primary control, secondary control, and working control), setting benchmarks and checking elevations. Those are the major uses of the total station.\n\nFor more information, or to understand the terms above (primary control, secondary control, traverse, etc.), please visit the following link:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.fieldengineermanual.com\">www.fieldengineermanual.com</a>","createdDate":"2018-04-08T22:41:51.257Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-21T02:22:44.306Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggSrCKdW63g?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:422404","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Thomas sets up the total station again!","description":"Thomas sets up the total station again!<a href=\"http://www.geo-logika.hu\">http://www.geo-logika.hu</a>","createdDate":"2018-04-08T20:49:39.102Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-21T09:24:42.010Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZ86KHAIof0?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:420939","contributorName":"31awaf5v71ljs","title":"AutoCAD to KML / AutoCAD to Google Earth","description":"View autocad drawing in Google Earth Pro by creating KML file from Autocad DWG or DXF files.

It was created in the mid 1980's as an interpretation of BLMs colorful history. The historical perspective presented centers around the uses, federal laws, and landmark events on Americas public lands which contributed to the fractured land ownership patterns that remain today.\n\nThe series is divided into 2 broad sections the first is called The Public Disposal Era and consists of videos 1 - 6. The second is called Conservation and Beyond and covers videos 7 -13.\n\nThe thirteen chapters in this chronology trace the settlement of the West from colonial times through the passage of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), which provides BLM with its multiple use mission.\n\nSet against the backdrop of dynamic economic, social, and environmental change, and with shifting national priorities, this series explains how the missions of the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service were merged with a stroke of the pen by President Harry S. Truman in 1946 to create the Bureau of Land Management\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions and statements of non-BLM personnel are included to illustrate alternative points of view at the time and do not necessarily represent the official position of the BLM.","createdDate":"2017-09-02T19:35:34.627Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-18T12:50:01.089Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEYQaLEW3xk?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:394003","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"How we use a transit, water level transit, lazer transit.

The destructive influence of mankind will be at least as disastrous as the asteroid element that wiped the dinosaurs off the planet. Reason for Dutch scientist Paul Crutzen to introduce a new geological period: the Anthropocene, or the age of mankind.\n\nOriginal title: Tijdperk van de mens\nGerman explorer Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) was one of the first to see how everything in an ecosystem is connected. Von Humboldt introduced the idea of \u200b\u200bthe Earth as a living organism in Western thinking, which eventually became the basis for the later environmental movement. Geologists from now see the impact of mankind at an increasing pace: climate warming, plastic soup, nuclear fallout, a disturbed water supply through erosion and tar sands, higher CO2 concentrations and diminishing biodiversity.\nDuring the last century, the influence of mankind on our Earth and atmosphere has become so great that it is judged by some scientists to be irreversible. To name this influence, a group of geologists recently proposed to date the Anthropocene back to 1950, with the exponential growth of the fossil economy. But earlier it was also discussed that the beginning of the industrial revolution was the starting point, or the first forms of agriculture or even the first mining in the Stone Age.\n\nThe influence of mankind on the Earth is so great that next generations will be able to see it back in the Earth's layers over hundreds of thousands of years. But if mankind really creates its own geological period, how can we deal with it in an adult way without reliance on a naive belief such as the self-solving ability of God or nature? How can mankind take responsibility and benefit from its influence? We are also finding solutions for climate change and depletion of our mineral resources here on Earth: from the cultivation of cucumbers in the desert, the mining of platinum into the space to the regreening of eroded land. Are these breakthrough just a bandaid on an hemorrhage or can mankind shape the Anthropocene by means of technological intervention so that we meet a viable future?\n\nWith: Andrea Wulf (historian and author of 'The Inventor of Nature', a biography of explorer Alexander von Humboldt), Bruno Latour (philosopher associated with Sciences Po in Paris and author of, among others, Facing Gaia. Eight Lectures on the New Climatic Regime ') and Phil Gibbard (British geologist setting up a working group to see if the Anthropocene can be introduced as an official geological term).\nOriginally broadcasted by VPRO in 2017.\n\u00a9 January 2017\n\nVPRO Documentary:\nOur globalized world causes societies, economies and cultures to seek a new balance. VPRO Documentary reflects on this with new features every week. We research subjects like politics, world economy, society and science with experts and try to grasp the essence of prominent trends and developments.","createdDate":"2017-08-13T22:23:23.509Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-28T19:08:19.907Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AW138ZTKioM?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:391859","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"How to download data from sokkia dx 101 ac","description":"Sokkia dx101 ac mein data download kaise karey pendrive se\nSokkia dx 101 stake out and line work <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZaXoDXt3wH0\">https://youtu.be/ZaXoDXt3wH0</a>\nSokkia dx 101 ac instrument setup <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JJfMi3ZvBvE\">https://youtu.be/JJfMi3ZvBvE</a>","createdDate":"2017-08-11T20:38:38.968Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-04T06:33:11.475Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BB8SSxKJS6c?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:391069","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Whole Circle Bearing and Reduced Bearing | Surveying","description":"In this video, I have explained about bearings with solved examples, and conversion of Whole Circle Bearing (WCB) to reduced bearing (RB)/Quadrant Bearing(QB).

Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is an enhancement to Global Positioning System that provides improved location accuracy, from the 15-meter nominal GPS accuracy to about 10 cm in case of the best implementations. DGPS uses a network of fixed, ground-based reference stations to broadcast the difference between the positions indicated by the GPS satellite systems and the known fixed positions. (Thank You WIKI )\n\nIn this modern era, the data should be accurate and precise. This DGPS gives exact Latitude and Longitude of the point required. There are two types of Survey which can be done using DGPS. They are Static and RTK. In Static Survey, both the DGPS works as a Rover and receives the Signal from Satellites.\n\nWanna Know More Please Check out the Whole Video!!\nAnd Also thinking What is RTK Survey, than do watch our next Video Regarding the same!! :)\n\nOur GEC, Bhavnagar has DGPS of Leica Geo Systems.

Following this procedure is the quickest way to set up your total station.\n\nStep 1: Extend the trip legs equally.\nStep 2: Space out the legs in an even triangle\nStep 3: Check the tripod head is roughly level\nStep 4: Lift the whole tripod and place it over the nail\nStep 5: Stand back and check that the nail is lined up with the centre of the tripod head from all sides\nStep 6: Hold the screw fixing vertically and at the centre of the tripod head and look down it to make sure it is centred over the nail.\nStep 7: Check that the tripod head is level\nStep 8: Stamp the feet of the tripod firmly into the ground. Check that it is still centred over the nail.\nStep 8: Take the total station out of the box and attach it to the tripod head\nStep 9: Looking through the optical plummet, adjust the footscrews until the black circle is centered over the nail.\nStep 10: Adjust the length of 2 of the legs until the circular bubble is centered.\nStep 11: Repeat steps 9 and 10 as many times as necessary until the nail is centered and the circular bubble is centered.\nStep 12: Alternatively, when the circular bubble is centered and you are quite close to the nail, loosen the fixing screw and slide the total station over the head of the tripod until centered.\nStep 13: Rotate the long bubble until it is parallel to two of the footscrews. Call them A and B. Footscrew C is the remaining footscrew.\nStep 14: Rotate A and B in opposite (counter) directions until the bubble is centered\nStep 15: Turn through 90 degrees\nStep 16: Use footscrew C on it's own to centralise the long bubble\nStep 17: Turn through 90 degrees\nStep 18: Rotate A and B in opposite (counter) directions until the bubble is centered\nStep 19: Turn through 90 degrees\nStep 20: Use footscrew C on it's own to centralise the long bubble\nStep 21: Turn through 90 degrees, back to the starting position. The long bubble should be centred.

Steadiness of the Survipod engineering tool ensures instruments such as the EDM, secured on the screw thread, are very safe and there is little chance that they will be knocked over accidentally. We have developed a survey tool that will provide you with more accurate results, while also saving you time and money.\n\nAll building surveyors and engineers in the Formwork and Shoring industry need to have the Survipod surveying tools on their site.","createdDate":"2017-02-03T00:09:47.610Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-22T09:09:17.056Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/109461200\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:364651","contributorName":"3uqywby404njw","description":"<p>Thanks again Survenator for showing my product.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kind Regards,</p>\n<p>James Reville</p>\n<p>Survipod Engineering Solutions Ltd</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.survipod.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.survipod.com</a></p>","createdDate":"2017-02-09T00:04:06.654Z"}]},{"id":"544331:Video:362057","contributorName":"1scrrs4xri6v8","title":"goats eat everything 2","description":"goats eat everything and GNSS, RTK Cables 2","createdDate":"2017-01-23T07:21:15.422Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-10T21:26:30.311Z","approved":"Y","videoAttachmentUrl":"videos/23-tmp11071.flv"},{"id":"544331:Video:361969","contributorName":"1scrrs4xri6v8","title":"goats eat everything","description":"goats eat everything and GNSS, RTK cables.","createdDate":"2017-01-23T07:17:43.319Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-16T08:49:55.375Z","approved":"Y","videoAttachmentUrl":"videos/24-tmp71458.flv"},{"id":"544331:Video:361967","contributorName":"1scrrs4xri6v8","title":"Flip it and Reverse it.","description":"Missy Elliott - Work It (from the album \"Under Construction\")","createdDate":"2017-01-23T07:11:22.613Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-17T19:54:16.962Z","approved":"Y","videoAttachmentUrl":"videos/25-tmp58671.flv"},{"id":"544331:Video:361635","contributorName":"1scrrs4xri6v8","title":"A day in the field- Surveying","description":"\"\"","createdDate":"2017-01-22T05:34:02.795Z","updatedDate":"2018-06-02T19:13:45.518Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mv6oo-CWohw?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:361439","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"How To Use Total Station in Surveying","description":"How To Use Total Station in Surveying Every Civil engineer Must watch This Video Please Share to All Friends..Please Subscribe Us To Provide a Good Support....","createdDate":"2017-01-19T22:41:45.934Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-14T11:41:10.455Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_EMrTbDZak?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:361436","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Measuring Vertical Angles","description":"Vertical angle measurements using a total station","createdDate":"2017-01-19T22:40:06.474Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-31T11:26:35.810Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3--4dUakI18?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:361574","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Remote Elevation Measurement (REM) with a Pentax Total Station","description":"This video shows how I measured the height of a utility pole outside my home using the built-in Remote Elevation Measurement (REM) program on my Pentaxt R-300 series total station.

Through the employment of Unmanned Aerial Systems, Drone2GIS delivers precise, high accuracy ortho-photos, digital terrain models and virtual realities. With these products, we can extract features and positions to produce the same products one would expect from a conventional survey without the safety risks of having boots on the ground. Data can be captured as and when needed without significant impact on the day to day operation of the site and at a fraction of the time it would otherwise take. Take stock of your inventory with accurate volume measurements, visualize your site without the stock piles, and get the data you need when you need it with minimal impact on production!\n\nSurveying in an opencast mine, quarry or a stock yard has challenges. Setting up terrestrial scanners and other survey devices in the traffic of heavy equipment either slows down production or poses serious safety risks to the survey crews. Other safety and health risks involve steep ledges, potential for rock/land slides, noise and dust. Conventional surveying takes time, involves more than one person and can be very expensive. In addition to the safety concerns, logistics can also become difficult as parts of the location may need to be shut down while the survey takes place.\n\nOur approach saves time and money while ensuring a safer operation without boots on the ground.

(The app automatically takes this into consideration when the comparison/check is taking place)\nAlso, when accepting a rise or fall value from either the first or second levelling run to alter either the first or second levelling run you must keep the sign (+ or -) of the value that is being altered.\n\nThe SurvEngLev levelling application is designed for onsite land Surveyors and Civil Engineering Surveyors to carry out Rise and Fall Levelling calculations on a mobile phone device out in the field. The application will compute the necessary calculations for two types of Rise and Fall levelling runs, these being:\n\n1) From a known point or Bench Mark to finish at another known point or Bench Mark.\n\n2) For a double run Rise and Fall levelling exercise in which there is no known point to finish the Rise and Fall levelling run on. (Only a Bench Mark to start from). If this is to be the case, then once the Surveyor/Engineer has got to the final Fore Sight Observation, He/she will reset the height of the levelling Instrument, Back Sight onto the final Fore Sight observation from the first Levelling run and work his/her way back up the same levelling run in the opposite direction (observing all the same points). The only values that are of interest from the second run are the Rise and Falls which should be (regardless of being Negative or Positive and within your specified tolerance) the same as the first Rise and Fall levelling Run. If the values don\u2019t match, then at least you know where the problem is and you can just simply go back out and re-observe the problem points to find out which of the rise and fall values was correct (or incorrect) from the two levelling runs.\n\nSurvEngLev will:\n\n1) Calculate Rise and Falls and Reduced Levels for first Levelling Run\n\n2) Calculate Rise and Falls only, for second Levelling Run\n\n3) Allows the Surveyor/Engineer specify a tolerance for the two compared levelling runs to fall within.\n\n4) Compare Rise and Falls of both first and Second Levelling Runs (Within your specified Tolerance)\n\n5) Show the Surveyor/Engineer which observations do not fall within tolerance.\n\n6) Allows the Surveyor/Engineer rectify and replace the Rise and Fall values that do not fall within specified tolerance with re-observed values that do fall within specified tolerance.\n\n7) The app will mean the processed rise and fall values of both levelling runs which are then applied to re-compute the reduced levels for the first levelling run.\n\n8) At each stage of SurvEng Lev there is a print function showing all observed and computed data which can copied to be sent out for further processing via the share function of your mobile device.\n\n9) All data is saved until the red re-set button located on the home screen is pressed.\n\n10) Any amount of Intermediate Sights can be input into the application.\n\n11) Stadia Tacheometry (Horizontal Sights) Is included within this app","createdDate":"2016-07-06T11:26:57.799Z","updatedDate":"2016-11-30T16:18:30.763Z","approved":"Y","videoAttachmentUrl":"videos/31-tmp13402.flv"},{"id":"544331:Video:338397","contributorName":"0ktoo1w6kllq8","title":"SurvEngTrav","description":"This app supports Android 4.4 and above and is available on Google Play\nThe primary design for this application is for onsite Engineering Surveyors to calculate Traverse data from hand booked angles and distances which can be calculated into final Station Coordinates quickly and precisely.

Compass surveying is a type of surveying in which the directions of surveying lines are determined with a magnetic compass, and the length of the surveying lines are measured with a tape or chain or laser range\u2005finder. The compass is generally used to run a traverse line. The compass calculates bearings of lines with respect to magnetic\u2005north. The included angles can then be calculated using suitable formulas in case of clockwise and anti-clockwise traverse respectively. For each survey line in the traverse, surveyors take two bearings that is fore bearing and back bearing which should exactly differ by 180\u00b0 if local\u2005attraction is negligible. The name Prismatic compass is given to it because it essentially consists of a prism which is used for taking observations more

The VTOL drone is being developed with a Tokyo robotics firm under a collaborative company called Aerosense.\n\nThe drone can carry up to 22 pounds, fly continuously for two hours, and reach a speed of 106 miles per hour. Sony is developing it for business customers, who would use it for \u201cmeasuring, surveying, observing and inspecting\u201d as soon as next year, so it will likely carry different types of instruments, depending on the task a customer requires.\n\nThanks to GPS World for sharing this tip: <a href=\"http://gpsworld.com/sonys-vertical-take-off-drone-aimed-at-surveyors/\">http://gpsworld.com/sonys-vertical-take-off-drone-aimed-at-surveyors/</a>\n\nAerosense, created this month, is a joint venture between Sony and Tokyo-based startup ZMP Inc., which specializes in autopilot technology. The venture is part of Sony\u2019s efforts to move beyond its core consumer products into enterprise markets. Aerosense will offer services such as inspecting aging infrastructure and surveying land that is difficult to access. The drones would be piloted automatically based on input from users about which areas they want surveyed.\nmore information : <a href=\"http://www.aerosense.co.jp\">http://www.aerosense.co.jp</a> Flight experiment of VTOL by Aerosense Inc.

You are watching this video because you just type in What is it like to be a Land Surveyor. I myself am a Land Surveyor. I've been a Land Surveyor for over 18 years. One word comes to mind when I think of Land Surveying... it is adventure. It definitely is an adventurous job. It's a job where never know what you are going to experience from day to day. One day you could be hiking up in the mountains, the next day you could be in a busy intersection, and another day you could be creating a brand new tract of homes. So it's definitely a job that is challenging and adventurous. Some of you may be watching this video looking for Land Surveying Job or a Land Surveying Career or you are looking for something new. It's definitely a job where I'm always learning. I'm using all sorts of different equipment like GPS, which is really fun equipment. I use a theodolite, which is a transit where I look through the instrument and find my sites. I do all kinds of hiking. I cut through brush like Indiana Jones. It's a fun and adventurous job. Depending on who you are working for and where you are living and what the pay rate is... some people do make a good living at it. Other people have to supplement their income. I myself am supplementing my income with a little side business I just started with a couple friends online. I'm actually transitioning out of Land Surveying and will be doing this full-time very soon to be making 6 and 7 figures.

Our innovative approach emphasizes the geometric and algorithmic perspective and was designed to be fun and accessible for learners of all levels.\n\nNumerous exercises will be provided via the Lemma system (under development)\n\nWe will cover the following topics:\nVectors\nLinear combinations\nDecomposition\nLinear independence\nNull space\nSpan\nLinear systems\nGaussian elimination\nMatrix multiplication and matrix algebra\nThe inverse of a matrix\nElementary matrices\nLU decomposition\nLDU decomposition\nLinear transformations\nDeterminants\nCofactors\nEigenvalues\nEigenvectors\nEigenvalue decomposition (also known as the spectral decomposition)\nInner product (also known as the scalar product and dot product)\nSelf-adjoint matrices\nSymmetric matrices\nPositive definite matrices\nCholesky decomposition\nGram-Schmidt orthogonalization\nQR decomposition\nElements of numerical linear algebra\n\nI\u2019m Pavel Grinfeld. I\u2019m an applied mathematician. I study problems in differential geometry, particularly with moving surfaces.","createdDate":"2015-03-20T21:37:09.040Z","updatedDate":"2017-10-18T18:07:29.110Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TprfUB3nI8Y?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:288746","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"National Surveyors Week March 21, 2014","description":"It's National Surveyors Week!

You can add additional features to your printout, including a title with description, a legend, and a custom HTML box that you can use to add more complex stuff, like your company logo or even a web page. All the elements are optional and can be moved around.

However, while using small UAVs for surveying is approved in most of the countries in the world, it is still in a legal limbo in the US.\n\nThis webinar will review the principles of using small UAVs for surveying with regular cameras, introduce multiple real-life case studies of surveying works using small UAVs, and provide practical hands-on best practices for using small UAVs in the field. The webinar will review the legal status of using UAVs in the US, and especially the two recent court cases involving the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and users of UAVs, where the FAA\u2019s policy memorandum on UAVs, particularly in regard to their being used for commercial purposes, was found to be not legally binding.\n\nPresented By: Eric Colburn, PLS","createdDate":"2014-11-01T23:21:04.011Z","updatedDate":"2018-02-01T08:27:52.992Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/8UJtLG07Lvo?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:278972","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Land surveying approach for designing a sustainable drainage infrastructure","description":"1.

Griffith) 1930","description":"This film was to be D.W. Griffith's big comeback production, and it did very well for \"the old master.\" In fact, it was chosen as number two of the Ten Best Pictures of 1930 by The Film Daily, just below \"All Quiet On The Western Front!\" Sadly, due to the horrible condition of the available prints of this film, no really fair analysis can be made today. As with so many early talkies, Abraham Lincoln is now a sickly shadow of what it was in 1930. To begin with, it's original running time is listed at approximately 96 minutes. The version presented on Laserdisc runs 83 minutes.The film shows signs of wear and duping. The soundtrack is horribly distorted and, in several scenes, seems to be missing totally, replaced by terrible music from a stock library. Even so, if one can look past these things and take the acting style in the context of its time, one can see that Griffith had not lost his flair and would have probably continued directing had the fates (and probably Hollywood) not conspired against him. There are wonderful cinematic moments, reminiscent of some of his earlier triumphs. This is a film that cries out for restoration but, alas, there is most likely little or nothing left to restore. UPDATE: In 2008, KINO International released a DVD version of Abraham Lincoln that is far more complete than the old Laserdisc I reviewed from in 1998. While some soundtrack from the Prologue is still missing, KINO has made up for it by adding subtitles for the missing dialogue. Also, the picture quality is far superior to anything else available. It is evident that much effort went into making this forgotten film much more watchable and available!\n\nDirected by D.W. Griffith. With Walter Huston, Una Merkel, William L. Thorne, Lucille La Verne.","createdDate":"2014-04-28T22:21:04.116Z","updatedDate":"2015-01-29T09:14:09.064Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/LYEn0adalUA?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:260310","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","description":"<p>nice movie!</p>","createdDate":"2014-04-29T00:06:05.854Z"}]},{"id":"544331:Video:260220","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"Surveyor (2011)","description":"This is a not to be missed short movie for any land surveyor! 'Surveyor' tells the story of a government agent surveyor on his way home to collect payment after having surveyed land on the western frontier. His trip home becomes a nightmarish journey through an American Gothic landscape. This is a true depiction of how the American West was lost.\n\nAs a 25 minute film, Surveyor might sound like it was conceived as a festival short, but its first submission was actually for Ridley Scott\u2019s YouTube short film contest. After making the first cut, the film got disqualified for including a quote by Cormac McCarthy without permission. The film was turned to festivals for a few projections, but slipped through most major festival selections. That\u2019s when director Scott Blake decided to bring his film back to the online afterlife. And since then, with just a little exposure, Surveyor has become one of the internet\u2019s hidden gems. The self proclaimed Anti-Western film created by Scott Blake, a first time director with no film experience who spent two years University years working on Surveyor, was his way of showing the lack of true american historical facts in almost all Hollywood western films.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmlethPictures\">https://twitter.com/AmlethPictures</a>\n\nFeatured in Filmmaker Magazine's 25 New Faces of Independent Film: <a href=\"http://filmmakermagazine.com/people/scott-blake/\">http://filmmakermagazine.com/people/scott-blake/</a>\n\nGENRE: anti-Western\n\n1848.

In this part, we will take a closer examination as to which specific LiDAR points are used for contour generation and the shortcomings of the classification process that users of LiDAR data need to be aware of and when it is appropriate to employ reclassification algorithms. In this example, we see what I've referred to as a hole in the ground, an area that is clearly on open lawn yet devoid of legitimate bare ground returns and which instead have been classified as UNCLASSIFIED. Reclassification of the UNCLASSIFIED pulses allows us to fill in that hole and thereby generate contours more closely representative of the truth on the ground.\n\nResources:\nUSGS Center for LIDAR Information: <a href=\"http://lidar.cr.usgs.gov/\">http://lidar.cr.usgs.gov/</a>\nUSGS Base Specifications used in 2010-2011 deliverables: <a href=\"http://lidar.cr.usgs.gov/USGS-NGP%20L\">http://lidar.cr.usgs.gov/USGS-NGP%20L</a>...\nMCC-LIDAR is a command line application (FREE) for processing LiDAR data in forested environments.

If wall thickness is unique, you can just pick up outer of building corners to create a ployline then offset inward by half of width of wall. If the wall thinness is not unique, in other word, varies with different segment, then you have to create some auxiliary lines to link all pair of corners in order to find out center of wall. And after creating the polyline, you need to delete all auxiliary lines. Is it possible to create polyline without creating auxiliary lines in advance, instead, can we just pick up wall corners then create the polyline straightforward? The answer is Yes. Just pick up points, then create polyline, no auxiliary lines, no deleting. That is it.","createdDate":"2014-02-23T19:12:39.059Z","updatedDate":"2017-09-30T17:34:15.701Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-ybiplVg8z4?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:254129","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Civil3D for Surveyors [62 Videos]","description":"Civil3D for Surveyors is a curated playlist of the most helpful Civil3D tips and tutorials for Land Surveyors on <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com\">http://landsurveyorsunited.com</a> This playlist includes the following tutorials:\nAutoCAD Civil 3D 2013 Manual Point Creation\nCivil 3D 2013 Overview\nCivil 3D User Defined Point Properties\nExport Civil 3D 2013 Drawing to Google Earth\nSurvey Translate Rotate Database\nHow to Display Points using Point Groups - Civil 3D\nCivil 3D Surface Elevation Label\nCivil 3D - Creating Points from Alignment Geometry.mp4\nV16 Create Surface Grading.mp4\nAutoCAD Civil 3D - Vertical Profile\nAutoCAD Civil 3D - Profile View\nCreating a Surface in AutoCAD Civil3D\nAutoCAD Civil 3D - Adding Contour Labels\nAutoCAD Civil 3D - Assembly\nAutoCAD Civil 3D - Corridors\nAutoCAD Raster Design 2011-Georeferensiranje [HD 720p]\nAutoCAD Civil 3D 2010 - Introduction to Survey rGuide Tutorial\nCivil 3D Data Migration - Converting Land Desktop Points\nCivil 3D 2013 - Point Creation Tools Tutorial\nAutoCAD Civil 3D 2011 - Setup a Drawing Template DWT Tutorial\nCivil 3D 2013 Surface Concepts\nExport Civil 3D 2013 Drawing to Google Earth\nUsing Quick Properties to Edit Points in AutoCAD Civil 3D\nCreate Parking with Path Array\nEdit Survey Figures in Civil 3D 2011\nPoint Descriptions and Description Keys\nSheet Set - Publish to Page Override\nCreate a Zoning Map using Civil 3D\nCreate an Elevation Exhibt Drawing\nAutoCAD Tutorial;

Setting up terrestrial scanners and other survey devices in the traffic of heavy equipment either slows down production or poses serious saftey risks to the survey crews. Other safety and health risks involve steep ledges, potential for rock/land slides, noise and dust. Conventional mine surveying takes time, involves more than one person and can be very expensive.\n\nThis video was created by Oliver and Walter Volkmann for Aibotix in 2012 to help them promote the use of their Aibot X6 in one of the more dangerous environments for surveyors. Based on the Mikrokopter Flight and Navigation controllers available today (<a href=\"http://www.mikrokopter.com\">www.mikrokopter.com</a>), the Aibot X6 is programmed to fly flight paths automatically. Due to limitations in the mikrokopter flight/navigation controller, photos are taken at time intervals calculated to provide the approximate overlap percentages required as special licenses are required if the user intends to fly more than 32 waypoints.\n\nThe Aibot X6, just like most VTOL UAVs / Multirotors on the market today, provides an efficient and profitable way to perform aerial mapping and is able to operate in conditions not suitable for conventional aerial photography. By using the imagery gathered during Aibot X6 automatic flights which are programmed using Mikrokopter Tools Waypoint Planning, high resolution orthophotos can be generated using third party software from which detailed models, suitable for measuring quantities, designing earthworks and general orientation in mine management and safety, can be built.","createdDate":"2014-01-27T18:37:59.340Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-13T14:39:00.531Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nDvxZQpPlxY?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:253277","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Site survey from uav drone and theodolite.","description":"Tripeera Present Site survey at Petchaboon Thailand by Uav drone and Theodolite.

As the Chief\nFinancial Officer puts it, he was \"next in line\" for a lucrative\ncontract.\n\n\nCounty Administration Meeting, October 24, 2013\n\nRosemary Padgett: \"The only, umm, other, uhh, request,\numm, I wanted to bring forward to you, umm...with the sign-\ning of the plat [Oct 17 Approval of Replat Map of Addition to\nThird Addition to Granite Hill Cemetery off of Pinecrest Drive],\nwe finalized, uhh, the Granite Hill Cemetery.\"\n\nKeith Heck: \"Um-hmm.\"\n\nPadgett: \"We received, umm, a second billing from Peter\nAllen, uhh, his surveying, not County Surveyor, but his sur-\nveying group.\"\n\nHeck: \"Um-hmm.\"\n\nPadgett: \"Uhh, for 7,140 dollars (long pause). Traditionally,\nthis would have came out of the Parks Operational [Budget],\nahh, but because of the cost of the of this, and it is really\na benefit to the property, I'd recommend that we pay this out\nof Property Reserve.\"\n\n\"Ahh, uht, we did not anticipate this large a bill, umm, and,\nuhh, the length of time it took for this to be completed.\n\n\"So...uhh.\"\n\nHeck: \"And you say 'the length of time,' you're talking about\nfour years or whatever it has been?\"\n\nPadgett: \"Exactly.\"\n\nHeck: \"Yeah...is it, was, was the con, I mean, and I'm ask-\ning you this out of ignorance, was the contract to do that,\nwas that put out to bid? Or how was that done?\"\n\nPadgett: \"We have a 'revolving' list of surveyors. So, when\nthis came up, umm, I couldn't tell you for sure how Peter\nAllen was, uhh, chosen, but I'm thinking it probably was\nbecause of the...the list.

Monitoring work can be done outside of danger area, whenever you want and at your time frame. Keep your survey crews away from rail lines and outside of danger zones.\n\nIt is possible to measure these targets from almost any angle. You do not need to shift the total station as often because you can reach many measuring points from one position.\nTo be more flexible on positioning with the total station, these targets are also often used on all pillars around the construction site.\n\nFor all monitoring work with robotic total station we offer the RSMP15 with mini prism that can be easily glued to any difficult surface without drilling, even on rail lines. Now accurate, low cost and complete round-the-clock monitoring of construction sites is possible.\n\nProblem areas on rail lines such as underground voids or severe track dips can now be easily verified and measured with our mini prism target even while the train is passing over the affected area.\n\nAll RS survey targets and control points are made of tough, UV resistant materials and are intended for discreet, long term, highly precise control and monitoring.","createdDate":"2013-10-07T22:11:25.605Z","updatedDate":"2016-08-02T21:02:45.270Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/vFoTblkPaRQ?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:244510","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Annoying Surveyor Pranks","description":"What surveyors can do to annoy the public.

The simulated earthquake is similar to the 2001 Nisqually earthquake but lasts longer, is closer to Seattle, or has a slightly greater magnitude.","createdDate":"2013-09-18T21:54:50.312Z","updatedDate":"2017-09-21T13:16:38.733Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/hos_uIKwC-c?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:241936","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Seabed Frontier: A Brief History of Bathymetry","description":"NIWA marine geologist John Mitchell gives a brief history of bathymetric (seabed) charting, and how it's been carried out over the last few hundred years.","createdDate":"2013-09-16T22:38:05.625Z","updatedDate":"2016-08-11T19:10:00.258Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/mMazvbbkWYk?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:241933","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Cable Belt Conveyor System Geodetic Surveying","description":"Surveyor, Arnel Domag of the Philippines shows us Topographic, Structural, Profiling, Property Intersection Geodetic Survey","createdDate":"2013-09-16T22:27:39.725Z","updatedDate":"2014-12-23T21:03:29.049Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/NFbITgN3aB0?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:241930","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Turn A Cell Phone Into A Modem For RTK Surveying","description":"Robot voice teaches you the basics for how to Turn A Cell Phone Into A Modem For RTK Surveying","createdDate":"2013-09-16T22:20:02.394Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-17T23:54:19.859Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/G53S9x1uLHU?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:242098","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"instalacion Base GPS Topcon","description":"instalacion Base GPS Topcon","createdDate":"2013-09-16T20:11:04.678Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-17T20:38:34.517Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3N9p47FGA1M?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:241997","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Surveyors tell govt to release remaining title deeds","description":"The Institution of Surveyors of Kenya has urged the government to release remaining title deeds to other parts of the country and called on politicians to stop politicizing the matter.

If you would therefore like to keep your email private and would not like anyone else to read your confidential Gmail messages except for the recipient, you should consider encrypting your email before sending them.\n\nThere are a couple of browser extensions that help you encrypt Gmail but here we discuss a new and more simple Google Docs based encryption method that works across all browsers and requires no add-ons or apps. You secure your message with a strong password and the recipient will have to enter the same password in order to decrypt your message.\n\nFor the technically oriented, our Google Docs based solution encrypts (and decrypts) your email messages using the industry-standard AES algorithm which is implemented in Google Apps Script using SJCL, a JavaScript library for cryptography developed at Stanford.\nYou can send secure and encrypted messages in Gmail with the help of Google Docs. .","createdDate":"2013-08-24T23:14:54.939Z","updatedDate":"2016-02-18T15:39:39.835Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/2e2uygCAntY?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:240330","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"<h3>Sender\u2019s Computer \u2013 Encrypt the message before sending</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Open Gmail and compose a new email message.

It was created in the mid 1980's as an interpretation of BLMs colorful history. The historical perspective presented centers around the uses, federal laws, and landmark events on Americas public lands which contributed to the fractured land ownership patterns that remain today.\n\nThe series is divided into 2 broad sections the first is called The Public Disposal Era and consists of videos 1 - 6. The second is called Conservation and Beyond and covers videos 7 -13.\n\nThe thirteen chapters in this chronology trace the settlement of the West from colonial times through the passage of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), which provides BLM with its multiple use mission.\n\nSet against the backdrop of dynamic economic, social, and environmental change, and with shifting national priorities, this series explains how the missions of the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service were merged with a stroke of the pen by President Harry S. Truman in 1946 to create the Bureau of Land Management\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions and statements of non-BLM personnel are included to illustrate alternative points of view at the time and do not necessarily represent the official position of the BLM.","createdDate":"2013-08-17T20:28:25.938Z","updatedDate":"2017-08-21T16:44:57.206Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CEYQaLEW3xk?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:239835","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"History of Surveying","description":"<h2>The history of surveying by Farber Surveying</h2>\nFarber Surveying is a full service land-use and surveying firm utilizing experience, extensive training, and the latest technology.

The vector from an observer (origin) to a point of interest is projected perpendicularly onto a reference plane; the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.\n\nAn example is the position of a star in the sky. The star is the point of interest, the reference plane is the horizon or the surface of the sea, and the reference vector points north. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the perpendicular projection of the star down onto the horizon.[2]\n\nAzimuth is usually measured in degrees (\u00b0).

Traditional definitions require a topographic map to show both natural and man-made features. A topographic map is typically published as a map series, made up of two or more map sheets that combine to form the whole map. A contour line is a combination of two line segments that connect but do not intersect; these represent elevation on a topographic map.<br/><br/>The Canadian Centre for Topographic Information provides this definition of a topographic map: A topographic map is a detailed and accurate graphic representation of cultural and natural features on the ground.<br/><br/>Other authors define topographic maps by contrasting them with another type of map; they are distinguished from smaller-scale \"chorographic maps\" that cover large regions, \"planimetric maps\" that do not show elevations, and \"thematic maps\" that focus on specific topics.<br/><br/>However, in the vernacular and day to day world, the representation of relief (contours) is popularly held to define the genre, such that even small-scale maps showing relief are commonly (and erroneously, in the technical sense) called \"topographic\".<br/><br/>The study or discipline of topography, while interested in relief, is actually a much broader field of study which takes into account all natural and man made features of terrain.<br/><br/>Topographic maps are based on topographical surveys. Performed at large scales, these surveys are called topographical in the old sense of topography, showing a variety of elevations and landforms. This is in contrast to older cadastral surveys, which primarily show property and governmental boundaries. The first multi-sheet topographic map series of an entire country, the Carte g\u00e9om\u00e9trique de la France, was completed in 1789. The Great Trigonometric Survey of India, started by the East India Company in 1802, then taken over by the British Raj after 1857 was notable as a successful effort on a larger scale and for accurately determining heights of Himalayan peaks from viewpoints over one hundred miles distant...<br/><br/>United States<br/><br/><br/></p>","createdDate":"2013-08-04T23:18:51.034Z"}]},{"id":"544331:Video:238774","contributorName":"2m247gw4rh3xh","title":"Topographic Maps: \"Grid Distance and Elevation\" pt1-2 1966 US Army Training Film","description":"Topographic Maps: \"Grid Distance and Elevation\" pt1-2 1966 US Army Training Film\n\"USE OF MILITARY GRID SYSTEM TO LOCATE POSITIONS; USE OF GRAPHIC SCALES TO MEASURE DISTANCE; USE OF CONTOUR LINES TO IDENTIFY TOPOGRAPHIC DETAIL.\"\n\nUS Army Training Film TF5-3719\n\nPublic domain film from the National Archives, slightly cropped to remove uneven edges, with the aspect ratio corrected, and mild video noise reduction applied.\nThe soundtrack was also processed with volume normalization, noise reduction, clipping reduction, and equalization (the resulting sound, though not perfect, is far less noisy than the original).","createdDate":"2013-08-04T23:08:27.036Z","updatedDate":"2017-09-24T09:08:02.051Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/mYLxZ_F7DEw?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:237529","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"The World Largest Crane LTM 15300 hebt Flutschutztor","description":"F\u00fcr die Demontage der Obhafenbr\u00fccke hebt Kronschnabel Franke mit seinem LTM 1500 einen Terex AC 160 auf einen Schwimmponton.\n\nIn English:\nFor the dismantling of the Obhafenbr\u00fccke Kronschnabel Franke raises his LTM 1500 a Terex AC 160 to a floating pontoon.","createdDate":"2013-07-26T21:30:50.337Z","updatedDate":"2018-05-31T12:44:09.646Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/KFZpUGKGrKY?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:237642","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"A day in the life of a crane operator","description":"Phil Harmon of Jake's Cranes takes us up in a tower gantry crane above the World Market Center in Las Vegas.","createdDate":"2013-07-26T21:28:31.036Z","updatedDate":"2018-05-15T03:14:27.283Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ib3c3lJfVAA?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:237820","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"Crane Rigging Safety","description":"Construction safety video on the subject of crane rigging.","createdDate":"2013-07-26T21:22:25.160Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-22T00:45:22.396Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zhz_uhc6lgw?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:237817","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"SkillsUSA 2010 Surveying Competition","description":"SkillsUSA 2010 Surveying Competition","createdDate":"2013-07-26T21:19:04.891Z","updatedDate":"2018-03-10T00:38:15.927Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/IAkHOeoTtz0?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:237637","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"ProMark 500 GNSS receiver for RTK land surveying","description":"ProMark 500 offers GPS+GLONASS+25 years of field-proven technologies for surveying and geodesy.

The point can then be fixed as the third point of a triangle with one known side and two known angles.\n\nTriangulation can also refer to the accurate surveying of systems of very large triangles, called triangulation networks. This followed from the work of Willebrord Snell in 1615--17, who showed how a point could be located from the angles subtended from three known points, but measured at the new unknown point rather than the previously fixed points, a problem called resectioning. Surveying error is minimized if a mesh of triangles at the largest appropriate scale is established first. Points inside the triangles can all then be accurately located with reference to it. Such triangulation methods were used for accurate large-scale land surveying until the rise of global navigation satellite systems in the 1980s.\n\nApplications\n\nOptical 3d measuring systems use this principle as well in order to determine the spatial dimensions and the geometry of an item. Basically, the configuration consists of two sensors observing the item. One of the sensors is typically a digital camera device, and the other one can also be a camera or a light projector. The projection centers of the sensors and the considered point on the object's surface define a (spatial) triangle. Within this triangle, the distance between the sensors is the base b and must be known. By determining the angles between the projection rays of the sensors and the basis, the intersection point, and thus the 3d coordinate, is calculated from the triangular relations.As these are very important for large areas of surveying.\n\nDistance to a point by measuring two fixed angles\n\nThe coordinates and distance to a point can be found by calculating the length of one side of a triangle, given measurements of angles and sides of the triangle formed by that point and two other known reference points.\n\nThe following formulae apply in flat or Euclidean geometry. They become inaccurate if distances become appreciable compared to the curvature of the Earth, but can be replaced with more complicated results derived using spherical trigonometry.\n\nCalculation\n\nTherefore\n\nUsing the trigonometric identities tan \u03b1 = sin \u03b1 / cos \u03b1 and sin(\u03b1 + \u03b2) = sin \u03b1 cos \u03b2 + cos \u03b1 sin \u03b2, this is equivalent to:\n\nFrom this, it is easy to determine the distance of the unknown point from either observation point, its north/south and east/west offsets from the observation point, and finally its full coordinates.\n\nHistory\n\nTriangulation today is used for many purposes, including surveying, navigation, metrology, astrometry, binocular vision, model rocketry and gun direction of weapons.\n\nThe use of triangles to estimate distances goes back to antiquity. In the 6th century BC the Greek philosopher Thales is recorded as using similar triangles to estimate the height of the pyramids by measuring the length of their shadows and that of his own at the same moment, and comparing the ratios to his height (intercept theorem); and to have estimated the distances to ships at sea as seen from a clifftop, by measuring the horizontal distance traversed by the line-of-sight for a known fall, and scaling up to the height of the whole cliff. Such techniques would have been familiar to the ancient Egyptians. Problem 57 of the Rhind papyrus, a thousand years earlier, defines the seqt or seked as the ratio of the run to the rise of a slope, i.e. the reciprocal of gradients as measured today. The slopes and angles were measured using a sighting rod that the Greeks called a dioptra, the forerunner of the Arabic alidade. A detailed contemporary collection of constructions for the determination of lengths from a distance using this instrument is known, the Dioptra of Hero of Alexandria","createdDate":"2013-04-26T20:07:51.848Z","updatedDate":"2015-07-17T23:34:06.544Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/d4-Yb6OutOg?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:175472","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Bare earth model with trees - Geospatial SBL","description":"This video shows parts of bare earth model created by SBL along with 3D canopy.

I can also see where having a backup copy of these thoughts in both audio and text (time-stamped) might come in handy. Perhaps you might need them for court one day (hopefully not). Maybe you might find it simpler to record and transcribe your thoughts so you can copy/paste them into a story on Land Surveyors United (hint hint). Nevertheless, Google Voice is an incredible tool with many possibilities for making your surveying life more organized and productive.\n\nGoogle Voice has actually one-upped Apples Visual Voicemail by adding the new voice transcription feature to what is already an incredible voicemail system. The audio for all of your messages is saved in an inbox that works just like an email inbox. This alone is pretty cool, but then they convert the message to text and put it in your inbox too.

Each circle is divided into 360 degrees, each degree into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds. The degree is symbolized by \u00b0 , the minute by \u2032, and the second by \u2033. Starting with 0\u00b0 at the equator, the parallels of latitude are numbered to 90\u00b0 both north and south. The extremities are the north pole at 90\u00b0 north latitude and the south pole at 90\u00b0 south latitude. Latitude can have the same numerical value north or south of the equator, so the direction N or S must always be given.\n\nStarting with 0\u00b0 at the prime meridian, longitude is measured both east and west around the world. Lines east of the prime meridian are numbered to 180\u00b0 and identified as east longitude; lines west of the prime meridian are numbered to 180\u00b0 and identified as west longitude. The direction E or W must always be given. The line directly opposite the prime meridian, 180\u00b0 , may be referred to as either east or west longitude. The values of geographic coordinates, being in units of angular measure, will mean more if they are compared with units of measure with which we are more familiar. At any point on the earth, the ground distance covered by one degree of latitude is about 111 kilometers (69 miles); one second is equal to about 30 meters (100 feet). The ground distance covered by one degree of longitude at the equator is also about 111 kilometers, but decreases as one moves north or south, until it becomes zero at the poles. For example, one second of longitude represents about 30 meters (100 feet) at the equator; but at the latitude of Washington, DC, one second of longitude is about 24 meters (78 feet).\n\nGeographic coordinates appear on all standard military maps; on some they may be the only method of locating and referencing a specific point. The four lines that enclose the body of the map (neatlines) are latitude and longitude lines. Their values are given in degrees and minutes at each of the four corners. On a portion of the Columbus map (Figure 4-4), the figures 32\u00b0 15' and 84\u00b0 45' appear at the lower right corner. The bottom line of this map is latitude 32\u00b0 15'00\u2033N, and the line running up the right side is longitude 84\u00b0 45'00\"W. In addition to the latitude and longitude given for the four corners, there are, at regularly spaced intervals along the sides of the map, small tick marks extending into the body of the map. Each of these tick marks is identified by its latitude or longitude value. Near the top of the right side of the map is a tick mark and the number 20'. The full value for this tick marks is 32\u00b0 20'00\" of latitude. At one-third and two-thirds of the distance across the map from the 20' tick mark will be found a cross tick mark (grid squares 0379 and 9679) and at the far side another 20' tick mark. By connecting the tick marks and crosses with straight lines, a 32\u00b0 20'00\" line of latitude can be added to the map. This procedure is also used to locate the 32\u00b0 25'00\" line of latitude. For lines of longitude, the same procedure is followed using the tick marks along the top and bottom edges of the map.","createdDate":"2013-03-03T16:56:45.117Z","updatedDate":"2016-07-02T01:05:06.697Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/a7rfibJMEv0?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:149367","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"<p>After the parallels and meridians have been drawn, the geographic interval (angular distance between two adjacent lines) must be determined.

The geographic coordinates of a point are found by dividing the sides of the geographic square in which the point is located into the required number of equal parts. If the geographic interval is 5'00\" and the location of a point is required to the nearest second, each side of the geographic square must be divided into 300 equal parts (5'00\" = 300\"), each of which would have a value of one second.

Traverse networks involve placing survey stations along a line or path of travel, and then using the previously surveyed points as a base for observing the next point. Traverse networks have many advantages, including:\nLess reconnaissance and organization needed;\nWhile in other systems, which may require the survey to be performed along a rigid polygon shape, the traverse can change to any shape and thus can accommodate a great deal of different terrains;\nOnly a few observations need to be taken at each station, whereas in other survey networks a great deal of angular and linear observations need to be made and considered;\nTraverse networks are free of the strength of figure considerations that happen in triangular systems;\nScale error does not add up as the traverse is performed. Azimuth swing errors can also be reduced by increasing the distance between stations.\nThe traverse is more accurate than triangulateration[2] (a combined function of the triangulation and trilateration practice).[3]","createdDate":"2013-02-26T23:39:41.458Z","updatedDate":"2018-02-11T20:21:18.208Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/pOdMEsi41hM?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:147345","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Compass for Surveyors","description":"This reinstallation of works from LACMA's American art collection emphasizes 19th century American landscape painting, and a selection of photographs from the same period.

Trimble SCS900 Site Controller Software helps efficiently control and quantify site operations without relying on a contract surveyor for site measurement and stakeout. It is easy to learn and can be used with Trimble GNSS or total station equipment.\nThe software organizes job site information the same way contractors already work, and an intuitive interface makes SCS900 easy to learn and use for tasks such as grade checking, staking or measuring as-builts. It increases productivity from day one.\nAdvanced communications help contractors realize significant savings by eliminating the time and cost of driving data files to and from the field. Engineers can send design changes and work orders to field crews, who can transfer progress reports, on-site problems, and as-built data back to the office at the touch of a button. This connectivity reduces delays and increases the likelihood that projects finish on time and under budget.\nOptional Roading and Advanced Measurement Modules include many additional time-saving features that are unique to those specific tasks.\nRoading Module\nThe Trimble SCS900 Roading Module supports road and highway projects by incorporating full alignment geometry, station equations, width transitions and multiple roadways within a selected road job. The Roading Module provides a single solution to all road staking needs - from roadway features to catch points to custom subgrades.\nIn addition, the grade checking functions allow contractors to easily perform as-built checks and quality control.\nAdvanced Measurement Module\nThe Trimble SCS900 Advanced Measurement Module improves informed decision-making by capturing additional information with each measured point; for example, photos, dimensions, conditions and material type add more valuable information about a feature than just its position. This information can be remotely sent back to the office and analyzed in Business Center.","createdDate":"2013-01-06T23:20:16.813Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-21T17:17:58.114Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cRD-Q5dQeoc?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:134629","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Hydrographic Surveying: Z-Boat 1800 Sonar Boat Single Beam Echo Sounder and ADCP Demo","description":"The Z-Boat 1800 makes for an unusual sight in central Moscow.

Design &amp; Animation by Dan Fleetwood.\nProduced by Humanstudio as part of the University of Sheffield's 'Festival of the Mind'.\n\nThe thinking behind this short film is to show that so much of what is studied in geography is part of a complex, evolving complexity. Individual \u2018facts\u2019 can be linked to other information to help build up a wider and better understanding of the world in which we live. Carl starts his new geography students off by suggesting that it is a \u2018join the dots\u2019 subject; all those snippets of information whirling around the world waiting to be connected in some way so a more complete understanding can be developed.\nHowever one of the fundamental principles of geography is that \u2018Everything is related to everything else (but near things are more related than distant things)\u2019. This is known as Waldo Tobler\u2019s first law of geography. It has been thought that globalisation and particularly the internet would lead to the \u2018death of distance\u2019, the \u2018Flat World\u2019 propounded by Thomas Friedman. Such thinking is an outright challenge to Tobler\u2019s law. It is true that the distant can now be near; in Sheffield that is increasingly felt by the rapid growth in non-UK students studying in the city. We can Skype, surf and stumble our way through a more complex world than we ever imagined even a couple decades ago and all from our smart phones where-ever we are.\nPerhaps more pertinently economic forces that develop far from Sheffield shape the city\u2019s fortunes. Whether that is the Chinese savings that provided a significant amount of the initial capital to fuel the ballooning private debt that has led to Sheffield and the UK mired in economic recession at the present time. Or it may be demand for basic food stuffs from a growing and increasingly wealthy global population that is helping to drive up the price of many staple food in the UK.\n\nUseful resource for exploring ideas of globalisation, networks, urban change and inequality.\nA Sheffield College, Sheffield University, Humanstudio collaboration\n\nMore details: <a href=\"http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/?p=2681\">http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/?p=2681</a>","createdDate":"2013-01-04T22:55:18.711Z","updatedDate":"2016-08-14T05:38:42.576Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8SNKHTHROR4?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:134458","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"Land surveyors in Action","description":"Land surveyors in Action Across the gully on a feeble tree","createdDate":"2013-01-02T18:44:32.117Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-31T17:58:12.552Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Z80sAL7FqiM?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:134190","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"\"What is Uber Weather?\" Part 2 - Google Earth Tour","description":"In Part 2 we jump into a demo of discovering a new place in Uber Weather, then exploring it further using Google Earth.

As I mentioned a few days ago with the Britain from Above story, Historical Imagery is certainly one of the best new features added to Google Earth in the past few years.\nOne interesting aspect of historical imagery is that it's not always old -- sometimes the \"historical\" imagery for a particular location might be newer than the base imagery. The key is that the imagery for the base layer of Google Earth is always what they consider to be the best imagery for that location. Freshness certainly plays into that, but so does lighting, cloud cover, etc. Quite often, Google will capture new imagery for a location but decide it isn't good enough for the base layer and will put it in the Historical Imagery layer instead.\nThe new Google Earth 5 has a great new feature letting you turn back the clock on aerial/satellite imagery.

Don't believe me? Go out onto the street and ask them about Geomatics. You'll get some weird looks. The video above was from a talk I gave to the SAIT Geomatics Engineering Technology class in early December 2012. My goal with the presentation wasn't to scare them away from Geomatics but to get them to think about Geomatics in a different manner.\n\nI'm not trying to belittle Geomatics. I've been in the industry since 2000 and have staked my entire career on Geomatics. I have an engineering degree in Geomatics and own a Geomatics company (but I don't call it a Geomatics company) so my stake in Geomatics is pretty high. But I think the Geomatics industry needs to evolve. I think the industry needs to stop thinking about Geomatics being something unique, in its own industry, requiring its own set of fancy words to describe what it does.\n\nClick here for the rest of the blog entry:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.advancedspatialdesign.com/nobody-cares-about-geomatics/\">http://www.advancedspatialdesign.com/nobody-cares-about-geomatics/</a>\n\nInfo about the presenter:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/ahcho\">http://www.linkedin.com/in/ahcho</a>\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00ad-------------\nASD Inc.

On each strip is a compass rose showing the direction of travel as well as the distance, in miles, from the start point.\n\n''The roads leading from Dublin are measured from His Majesty's Castle Gate, to the Market House of every Town; and the Cross Roads from the Market House of one Town to another. The lists of stages at the top of the pages show the distance from one stage to another; also the distance from Dublin, or the other place, where the Road is measured from. ... with the distances in Irish miles. Eleven Irish miles are equal to fourteen British.''\n\nRare antique map.\n\nFrom the first edition of this handsome atlas, produced by Scottish surveyors George Taylor and Andrew Skinner.

The maps were engraved by G.

You have distributed and collected survey data using a questionnaire with a number of questions. Now you want to enter the data and create cross-tables in Excel. Eventually you also want to export the raw data into SPSS for further analysis.\n\nFirst you must enter the name of the variables in the first row, then enter the raw data in the following rows. Second, to create cross-tables, select your data (including the first row with the variable names), click on the Insert-tab, click Insert Pivot table, and insert the empty table into the worksheet. From the right side, drag one variable to the rows and another to the columns. Also, drag the last one to the main data field. By default, Excel might work with sums, and that ruins the table. We need to change that, by right-clicking in the main data field and dragging down to Summarise data by and select Count (the table will now show frequencies).\n\nTo export the raw data to SPSS: Save as an ordinary Excel file. Close the file (or quit excel) and start SPSS. In SPSS, click File, drag down to Open and select Data. Make sure you tell SPSS that you want to open an excel file, else the file will now show up. Once you located the file, open it.","createdDate":"2012-10-04T22:20:57.219Z","updatedDate":"2014-04-23T09:54:06.238Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Rwta1lXUoq4?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:122352","contributorName":"038hwxbbrarg2","description":"good but how can download??","createdDate":"2012-10-25T14:13:44.415Z"}]},{"id":"544331:Video:117496","contributorName":"0qayyzulla5a3","title":"Casio Fx9860G Lot Data Computation","description":"Demo of Lot Data Computation for Casio Fx9860G SD Graphic Calculator using the Big Shots Integrated Land Survey Program.","createdDate":"2012-09-21T20:59:55.080Z","updatedDate":"2016-08-11T14:33:46.059Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/A5hedlylEtU?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:117567","contributorName":"0qayyzulla5a3","title":"Casio Fx9860G Traverse Computation","description":"Demo of Traverse Computation for Casio Fx9860G SD Graphic Calculator using the Big Shots Integrated Land Survey Program.","createdDate":"2012-09-21T20:55:23.418Z","updatedDate":"2015-03-15T20:01:58.387Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/jHViwps2t7Q?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:117762","contributorName":"0qayyzulla5a3","title":"Casio Fx9860G Old Survey   Boundary Computation","description":"Demo of Old Survey/ Boundary Computation for Casio Fx9860G SD Graphic Calculator using the Big Shots Integrated Land Survey Program.","createdDate":"2012-09-21T20:48:27.927Z","updatedDate":"2015-01-18T03:41:29.772Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LhRBGxT_MIE?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:117493","contributorName":"0qayyzulla5a3","title":"Land Survey Setting Stakeout using Casio Fx9860G","description":"Using bigshots land survey program to compute settings or stakeouts in casio fx9860g programmable calculator.

You have distributed and collected survey data using a questionnaire with a number of questions. Now you want to enter the data and create cross-tables in Excel. Eventually you also want to export the raw data into SPSS for further analysis.\n\nFirst you must enter the name of the variables in the first row, then enter the raw data in the following rows. Second, to create cross-tables, select your data (including the first row with the variable names), click on the Insert-tab, click Insert Pivot table, and insert the empty table into the worksheet. From the right side, drag one variable to the rows and another to the columns. Also, drag the last one to the main data field. By default, Excel might work with sums, and that ruins the table. We need to change that, by right-clicking in the main data field and dragging down to Summarise data by and select Count (the table will now show frequencies).\n\nTo export the raw data to SPSS: Save as an ordinary Excel file. Close the file (or quit excel) and start SPSS. In SPSS, click File, drag down to Open and select Data. Make sure you tell SPSS that you want to open an excel file, else the file will now show up. Once you located the file, open it.","createdDate":"2012-08-22T00:29:22.902Z","updatedDate":"2014-11-23T16:25:44.500Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Rwta1lXUoq4?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:112532","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"Creating County Overlays with Google Maps Javascript API","description":"Full tutorial at <a href=\"http://elliottmediagroup.com/2011/01/maps-api\">http://elliottmediagroup.com/2011/01/maps-api</a> I show you how to create an overlay on a Google Map of a US county.

EAGLES is a PC-based series of linked software applications (decision support tools or DSTs) in user-friendly ArcGIS and web-enabled environments that allows biologists and managers direct control and access to powerful data processing and modeling capabilities. There are six basic DSTs within EAGLES. Together they form a workflow architecture to allow practitioners: (1) direct access to, and understanding of, climate and biophysical data products for ecosystem vulnerability assessments, (2) creation of conceptual, visual, and statistical models of species populations responding to environmental change, (3) to explore What-if-Scenarios about how species and their habitats respond to habitat alterations and future climate conditions. EAGLES also provides the basis for common data, standardized data protocols, and transparent analysis techniques applicable across all LCC units. One fundamental component of EAGLES is access to a large suite of NASA-produced remote sensing products to use as covariates for modeling purposes.

The second is called Conservation and Beyond and covers videos 7 -13.\n\nThe thirteen chapters in this chronology trace the settlement of the West from colonial times through the passage of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), which provides BLM with its multiple use mission.\n\nSet against the backdrop of dynamic economic, social, and environmental change, and with shifting national priorities, this series explains how the missions of the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service were merged with a stroke of the pen by President Harry S. Truman in 1946 to create the Bureau of Land Management\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions and statements of non-BLM personnel are included to illustrate alternative points of view at the time and do not necessarily represent the official position of the BLM.","createdDate":"2012-07-27T21:19:41.651Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-04T00:57:21.508Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/b7pw-RMoid8?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:109526","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"11 - Creating The BLM","description":"This 13 part series, known as Fractured Land Patterns, is the history of BLM.

Perfect for surveyors on the move\n<div>With the latest update to Google Map Maker: the\u00a0\"Overlay\" feature,\u00a0you can now add your own maps and images on top of the regular map to help orient yourself and guide your mapping.</div>\n<div><strong>1. Enable Overlays</strong></div>\n<div>First, make sure that Overlays are enabled on Map Maker. To do this, access the \"Labs\" by clicking the green labs icon <img src=\"http://www.google.com/mapmaker/mapfiles/labs_bar_icon.gif\" alt=\"\"/> on the top right-hand corner of the screen. Then make sure that \"Overlays\" is switched to \"Enabled\" and click \"Save\". The \"Overlays\" button should now appear before the \"Map\" and \"Satellite\" buttons on the viewport.</div>\n<div><strong>2. Find or Make Content</strong></div>\n<div>To access\u00a0<a href=\"http://earth.google.com/userguide/v4/ug_kml.html\">KML</a> maps or Images in Google Map Maker with the Overlay feature, this content will need to be online and you will need its web address. See \"Where to host content\" for suggestions. In this tutorial, we will use a KML map already online from <a href=\"http://www.panoramio.com/\">Panoramio</a>, a Google-run website where users can share geotagged photos.<div><strong>3. Add Content to Map Maker</strong></div>\n<div>Once you have a web address for the content you'd like to see in Google Map Maker, you can add this web address to your Overlays. To do this, first go to the Google Map Maker homepage: <a href=\"http://mapmaker.google.com\">http://mapmaker.google.com</a> and sign in using your Google Account. Next, click on the \"Overlays\" tab on the upper-right hand corner of the map view. (see image below)</div>\n<div><div><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://google.com/help/hc/images/mapmaker/mapmaker_1094314_overlays.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Click the \"Manage overlays\" button. This will open a window where you can add KML and Image web addresses. For this tutorial, copy the following Panoramio KML url text:\u00a0<a style=\"color: #c21d0c;\" href=\"http://www.panoramio.com/kml\">www.panoramio.com/kml</a>\u00a0\u00a0, enter it under the section that says \"KML:\" in the dialog box, and click \"Add\".\u00a0(see image below)\u00a0When you are finished managing your overlays, simply click \"OK\".</div>\n<div><div><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://google.com/help/hc/images/mapmaker/mapmaker_1096074_add_aan_overlay_en.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div><strong>4. Enjoy Mapping with new Data!</strong></div>\n<div>If adding the web address of the Panoramio KML file has worked, you will see the image below. When zooming in, you may need to pause in an area for some time for the KML file to load.\u00a0Overlays will only be kept while you have Google Map Maker open your web browser as they are not stored with your user account.\u00a0\u00a0If you close or refresh your browser, you will need to repeat the steps above again to see your Overlays.</div>\n<div><div><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://google.com/help/hc/images/mapmaker/mapmaker_1094314_photo_layer_en.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div><div>Click the \"Overlay\" button to turn on and off the overlays.\u00a0Click the \"Manage overlays\" link again to add and remove your overlays.\u00a0If you want to add more URLs, you can continue to enter them one at a time under the appropriate \"KML\" or \"Image\" field and click \"Add\". To remove a link, simply click on the boxed \"X\" next to the URL you'd like to remove. Connecting to too many links may slow down your Map Maker connection.</div>\n</div>\nYou can now turn on and off the Overlays tab as you like in order to better help you map. Panoramio photos are great for helping you see what areas look like on the ground. This will let you orient yourself when looking at the world from above as well as give you ideas of what additional landmarks, points of interest, etc. may be worth adding to</div>","createdDate":"2012-07-22T20:40:21.855Z","updatedDate":"2015-03-16T07:27:27.231Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/XxGONUm7l3A?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:157413","contributorName":"1k03d930aso00","description":"<p>can not view video error msg \"this video is private\"</p>","createdDate":"2013-03-24T17:09:39.309Z"}]},{"id":"544331:Video:108844","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"Making a Google Map Overlay","description":"a short screencast describing how to create a Google 'my map' overlay, then share, collaborate and use it on your own website. <a href=\"http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/wip/\">http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/wip/</a>...","createdDate":"2012-07-22T20:34:25.277Z","updatedDate":"2018-05-10T00:11:06.262Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/qpfvA__bugQ?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:108549","contributorName":"0axadg5bb2xin","title":"Stockpile Volumes with Mobile LiDAR","description":"Stockpiles were scanned using the Topcon IP-S2 mobile mapper.

X-TRAC 7 provides fast prism tracking even when exposed to other reflective objects. The system uses an on/off cycle for the tracking beam and signal size measurement logic to determine what is a prism and what is a shiny object that should be ignored. Non-prism objects are automatically ignored. The total station\u2019s long range power also translates into unparalleled short range performance. The system provides pinpoint accuracy with a narrow, focused beam. Completely cable-free, the total station features an integrated, full-color graphical Windows\u00ae CE color touch screen interface, backlit keyboard, and super-fast robotic servo technology. A 2.4 GHz interference-free Spread Spectrum Radio is built into the side panel of the instrument, so no off-board dedicated channel radios are needed for remote operation. The 1,000 meter range between the instrument and the field controller (sold separately) provides an impressive communications range for the components of your system. The waterproof, dustproof instrument design withstands even the harshest job site conditions. Specifications Angle Measurement \u2013 Method: Absolute Reading. Horizontal: 2 sides. Vertical: 2 sides.

Here is my definition of Civilian Grade; any GPS unit with an accuracy above 20ft. These types of receivers can be Cell Phone GPS units, Garman units, Tom Tom\u2019s, in car GPS units, etc. These receivers tend to be able to lock onto a signal under trees and in vehicles. They are usually used to find your way to and from a geographic location such as geocaching, navigation, turn by turn directions, etc. \u201cDo these units have a place in the GIS Industry\u201d you may ask. The answer is absolutely! We use them in our Work Order Management Solution Spatial Links to navigate to a work order. They can be used to map certain GIS Features that do not require high accuracy such as the location of a house for a marketing survey or for storm weather tracking but they would not be best utilized to map a driveway entrance of a home for 911 or to map a valve for a utility.\n\nMapping Grade GPS:\n\nIn the last few years the definition of Mapping Grade GPS has changed significantly. It used to simply mean a GPS unit capable of creating a point in space at 1 meter (3.3 feet) or so. Now, the accuracy of Mapping Grade units range from 10 Centimeters (4 inches) to 1 meter (3.3 feet). In addition it is quickly becoming the norm for Mapping Grade Receivers to have cell phone technology and high res cameras such as the Trimble GeoXH 6000 handheld. They also should facilitate ease of use regarding capturing data, recording information about that data (attributes) and getting that accurate robust data back into the GIS/CAD system quickly and easily.\n\nSurvey Grade Receivers:\n\nThere is no confusion as to what a Survey Grade Receiver is. This type of unit is accurate below 1 centimeter (0.4 inches). My definition is if you need to map an ants butt then you need survey grade. These types of units are used to depict ownership of property and trust me people want every inch of property they can get. In order for a surveyor to be able to put his stamp on a plat or drawing he has to know what he surveyed is correct. The other uses for this type of equipment are shooting inverts of Sewer/Stormwater pipes, High Accuracy GIS, ground control for aerial surveys and Accident Mapping for Police Departments among others.\n\nSo to answer the questions:\n\nWhat is the best way to map your system for GIS? &gt; Mapping Grade\n\nWhat solution might get me where I need to go? &gt; Civilian Grade\n\nWhat does my Engineer need when he asks me for your GIS data? &gt; Survey Grade","createdDate":"2012-06-17T14:50:54.670Z","updatedDate":"2015-12-23T13:43:16.456Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ieb0bzNHAgQ?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:103558","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"Tour Canada's Boreal Forest | Google Earth","description":"For our surveyors in Canada...

On Survey Earth Day, the geospatial professionals of the world will have a chance to change that.\nOn the day of the summer solstice June 20 2012, geospatial professionals around the world and members of Land Surveyors United (a global support network for land surveyors) will be simultaneously recording survey grade GPS data from thousands of points around the globe, in order to gain a more accurate understanding of the earth's surface. The first annual Survey Earth in a Day event will be an ongoing annual social surveying education experiment, with a mission not only to learn more about the earth's surface but also monitor its changes over time, as a global community.Our results will change the knowledge we currently have of the shape of the earth and thus provide new information about our planet's surface for the benefit of all man-kind. Help the surveying industry and the surveyors in your region of the world by representing your area as we re-measure the entire globe in one single day!\nIf you are a geospatial professional with access to survey grade GPS equipment, you should consider helping us set a world's record, right from where you live and work! Only a surveyor can provide the kind of precision that will be needed to truly understand the shape of planet earth. Just imagine how much this can help our industry.\n\nSurvey Earth in a Day is hosted by Land Surveyors United network. <a href=\"http://surveyearth.com/\">http://surveyearth.com/</a>\n\nFollow Survey Earth in a Day on Twitter @surveyearth","createdDate":"2012-05-13T17:59:38.920Z","updatedDate":"2018-06-15T07:33:52.624Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/NiBmnQpvyyM?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:100907","contributorName":"3i7uq8ojnbaej","title":"Land Surveying in Vernon County, Wisconsin","description":"Land Surveying in Vernon County, Wisconsin.

Over time the metal parts in your ike naturally become magnetized. We try hard to limit the number of ferrous components but there are still a few floating around in the unit. This calibration will get your compass back to factory settings by compensating for those magnetic parts that become magnetized during normal operations. Make certain you have the most recent ikeOS and go out and calibrate your ike. It will take from start to finish about 2 minutes.

One effective way to reduce your phone bill is that you turn off images in your phone\u2019s browser or, if you don\u2019t want to spoil the web experience, you may consider getting Opera on your phone (m.opera.com).\n\nWhen you access a website through Opera, it first downloads that page on to its own servers where the page is compressed and then delivered to your phone. Thus, your phone has to download lesser amount of kilobytes when you access the same website through Opera.\n\nOpera says that their servers compress web pages by as much as 80% but there was no real way to verify that number. Until now.\n\nOpera has updated their Android browser and it now gives you an exact idea of how much data you have downloaded during your current browsing session and how much bandwidth you have saved because of Opera\u2019s compression. It also keeps track of the total data usage which may help you pick a more optimal data plan in your next billing cycle.\n\nopera data usage\n\nTo see your phone\u2019s data usage through Opera, launch the browser, click the Opera icon and choose \u201cData Usage\u201d under the Help section.","createdDate":"2011-10-12T18:28:35.387Z","updatedDate":"2011-10-12T18:30:47.558Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MVZNTV-cAMg?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:68061","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"Import GIS data into Google Earth","description":"If you have Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data, you can import it into Google Earth Pro so it can be used as part of your Google Earth visualizations.","createdDate":"2011-10-12T18:03:46.206Z","updatedDate":"2014-09-19T11:04:18.489Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/p9EgI_RbXBU?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:67857","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"Introduction to GIS (Geographic Information Systems)","description":"I noticed there are no 'introduction to GIS' videos on youtube so I decided to make one.

It is used with a total station equipped with a sighting that does not require a prism (Direct Reflex). It can be operated from a distance as far as a thousand meters (+1000 meters or +3280feets) and offers a 360 degree visibility. This target has numerous qualities such as durability, great visibility, reusability and extreme precision. Its operating procedure is quite easy: after the conventional set-up of the instrument, you simply install the target and aim at it in order to enter its coordinates. You will not have to change positions like you used to in order to set up different landmarks, such as metal rods, nails, survey monuments, etc., which are usually situated very far from the total station. Therefore, the TDR360 makes the operation of the instrument exceptionally fast and precise since the target is stationary. Furthermore, your triangulation network will be more reliable and accurate since the handling procedures in creating your network will be abated.","createdDate":"2011-09-30T23:54:36.281Z","updatedDate":"2016-08-07T10:45:56.878Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Wxn06sOYmEI?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:66581","contributorName":"3i7uq8ojnbaej","title":"Surveying in the Fast Lane?","description":"I could not resist filming something when I found this sign in a wooded area which is approximately 1 kilometer from the nearest road.

But why start a Google Plus account when you already have a Facebook account? Well, Facebook was developed on the premise that everyone is your \"friend\" which isn't how your social circles work in real life. Google plus is built so that you can intuitively break up all your connections into \"circles\" and treat each circle separately. (Facebook allows you to do some of the same things but the privacy settings are confusing and constantly changing.)\n\nGoogle Plus has a lot of slick features, but the biggest reason to open a Google Plus account is that if you use a lot of Google products you will inevitably get one some day.\n\n<h2>How Would a Land Surveyor Use Google Plus</h2>\nBriefly, consider grouping your fellow land surveyors into a \"circle\" called something like \"Surveyors\" and when you have surveying-related news or information that you think other surveyors should know about, simply choose the \"Surveyors\" circle when sharing that type of information. Unlike Facebook (where a share or like can be seen by ALL of your contacts)&lt; Google + allows you to share certain types of content with \"certain types\" of friends.\n\nFollow Land Surveyors United on Google + by following this link: <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.visibli.com/2472f54c426b60fc/?web=a2ace1&amp;dst=https%3A//plus.google.com/111469484153302555478\">http://landsurveyorsunited.visibli.com/2472f54c426b60fc/?web=a2ace1&amp;dst=https%3A//plus.google.com/111469484153302555478</a>","createdDate":"2011-07-24T23:26:43.888Z","updatedDate":"2017-06-10T02:26:34.740Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hC_M6PzXS9g\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:51391","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"ESRI UC - Concept Total Station on a GPS pole","description":"While setting up at the ESRI UC, we caught up with Bruce Carlson, president of Carlson Software, and discussed a not yet released, concept GIS/Surveying \"tot...","createdDate":"2011-07-23T23:45:50.498Z","updatedDate":"2012-08-29T03:01:32.662Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0gk89RwC7U\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},{"id":"544331:Video:49238","contributorName":"2rod9m6x7q78k","title":"TOPOGRAFO EN ACCION-COSTA RICA.wmv","description":"TOPOGRAFIA EN COSTA RICA-GUANACASTE \"ESTUDIA LO QUE TE GUSTA Y NUNCA TENDR\u00c1S QUE TRABAJAR\"","createdDate":"2011-07-16T04:51:19.022Z","updatedDate":"2016-05-03T00:47:05.742Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/3WUbbNMHnd4?version=3\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"false\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"never\"></param><embed wmode=\"opaque\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/3WUbbNMHnd4?version=3\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" allowscriptaccess=\"never\" allowfullscreen=\"false\"></embed> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param></object>"},{"id":"544331:Video:49876","contributorName":"2rod9m6x7q78k","title":"ETCG UNA","description":"Video sobre la Escuela de Topograf\u00eda, Castastro y Geodesia de la Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica.

We need Media help to expose them. They are overlooking the facts. I have a boundary problem and very fortunately I and my neighbour have Special Boundary Deeds marked to the very inch. I employed a Surveyor and he marked it against me in the favour of my neighbour. He gave my report to my neighbour FREE of charge without my knowledge and he is asking me to pay for the services. The report is in the favour of my neighbour and against me. So, I employed another Land Surveyor specialising in Boundary demarcation using Laser mapping. She, the lady Surveyor, did the laser mapping and put the boundary almost correct but she shifted my neighbour's encroachment away from me by 16 inches showing in her report that there is very little encroachment not worth bothering. This Surveyor charged me \u00a31500 + VAT upfront. Now, both of these reports are not professional and I wants to bring into the notice of Media that how these professionals instead of solving the problems through their professionalism rather create problems. They being the members of the RICS, are also taken by Judges as expert in this matter. I wonder if Media would be interested in highlighting the malpractices in such professional bodies. I warned both the Surveyors that I being a retired lecturer in Metallurgy can read drawings and mark the boundary but the solicitors need a professional document from you. I did mark the boundary for them and there was hardly ten feet boundary in dispute plus or minus 3 inches. If you are interested, I can explain and provide solid proofs of what I am saying and claiming. There could be an element of racism as I am an Asian and my neighbour is a white.

Some 30 plus years ago an EDM reflector or prism was mounted on top of the rod, followed, in recent years by a GPS receiver, and in some applications, a data collector.<br/><br/>In the traditional survey process, the rod is positioned at the desired location and a measurement taken. In the set out application the rod is moved over and over again until the desired position is found. Once the desired position is found the rod is moved out of the way and the point is set. The rod is then returned to the set point and another measurement is taken to check the accuracy and if needed the rod is removed and the set point is adjusted. This process is repeated over and over again until the desired accuracy is achieved.<br/><br/>The Zip Staker\u2122 places the reflector receiver with a laser light plumbing device directly over each other on a pivoting swing arm. The Zip Staker\u2122 can be mounted on top of any survey rod or tribrach adaptor with the standard 5/8 by 11 threads. The rod is moved into close proximity of the setout position, 3 or 4 tenths of a foot. The Zip Staker\u2122 has a working radius of approximately 0.8 feet measured from the center of the rod. With the aid of a bipod or similar device the rod is plumbed and the Zip Staker\u2122 is then pivoted until the rod person using the data collector or the instrument operator finds the Zero, Zero position. With the aid of a bipod the surveyor can concentrate on the rod mounted data collector watching for the Zero, Zero position. The surveyor need not concentrate on plumbing the rod and watching the data collector simultaneously. With the laser light plumbing device attached to the Zip Staker\u2122 the light is visible on the ground and the point can be set and adjusted if need be without repetitive movements of the rod. The light is continually visible on the ground while the point is being set.<br/><br/>The Zip Staker\u2122 is also a valuable tool when measuring existing structures or features such as the corner of a concrete slab or any elevated vertical surface. Anyone working in the field will testify that it can be challenging to put the rod tip on the corner of concrete while hold the rod in position and the measurement is taken. The Zip Staker\u2122 can be placed near the corner of concrete and pivoted into position until the laser light designator is shining on the concrete edge. The measurement can then be taken accurately on a vertical surface without the frustration of trying to position the rod</p>","createdDate":"2010-12-07T03:31:46.715Z","updatedDate":"2016-07-21T11:41:59.602Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/dsMkWNia8jM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"never\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/dsMkWNia8jM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"never\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed> </object>"},{"id":"544331:Video:31730","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"Surveying - A Life Without Limits","description":"Surveying is the perfect profession.

Why are California and Texas so large when so many of the states in the Midwest are roughly the same size and shape? Why are Alabama and Mississippi almost exact mirror images of each other?\n\nMark Stein provided answers to these questions, and many more, when he discussed and signed his new book, \"How the States Got Their Shapes,\" in a program sponsored by the Center for the Book. The author used the Library's Geography and Map Division and other Library resources in his research.\n\nThe map of the United States is so familiar that its state borders seem as much a part of nature as mountains and rivers, Stein says. \"How the States Got Their Shapes\" is the first book to explain why state lines are where they are. Anecdotal in nature, the guide reveals the moments in American history that put the giant jigsaw puzzle of the nation together.\n\nSpeaker Biography: Mark Stein is a playwright and screenwriter. His plays have been performed off-Broadway and at theaters around the country. His films include \"Housesitter\" with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. He has taught writing and drama at American University and Catholic University and lives in Washington, D.C.","createdDate":"2010-11-13T03:29:21.090Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-23T21:30:07.821Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<object width=\"640\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2KG58PI2K70?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"never\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2KG58PI2K70?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"never\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></embed> </object>"},{"id":"544331:Video:29876","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"Land Surveyor, Part 4: Azimuth Determination by Celestial Observation","description":"Land Surveyor, Part 4: Azimuth Determination by Celestial Observation -

As a result of that construction, 2D codes can store up to 7,089 characters, significantly greater storage than is possible with the 20-character capacity of a unidimensional barcode.</p>\n<p>2D barcodes are also known as quick response codes because they enable fast data access. 2D barcodes are often used in conjunction with smart phones.

It provides reliable positioning, navigation, and timing services to worldwide users on a continuous basis in all weather, day and night, anywhere on or near the Earth.\n\nGPS is made up of three parts: between 24 and 32 satellites orbiting the Earth, four control and monitoring stations on Earth, and the GPS receivers owned by users. GPS satellites broadcast signals from space that are used by GPS receivers to provide three-dimensional location (latitude, longitude, and altitude) plus the time.\n\nSince it became fully operational on April 27, 1995, GPS has become a widely used aid to navigation worldwide, and a useful tool for map-making, land surveying, commerce, scientific uses, tracking and surveillance, and hobbies such as geocaching. Also, the precise time reference is used in many applications including the scientific study of earthquakes and as a time synchronization source for cellular network protocols.\n\nGPS has become a mainstay of transportation systems worldwide, providing navigation for aviation, ground, and maritime operations. Disaster relief and emergency services depend upon GPS for location and timing capabilities in their life-saving missions. Everyday activities such as banking, mobile phone operations, and even the control of power grids, are facilitated by the accurate timing provided by GPS.

Along with items like your car GPS navigation system, many items in Google Earth (such as these ships, real-time air traffic or following Frank) require GPS to enable us to see their current location.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Air Force launched a new satellite (the GPS IIF SV-1), the first in a series of launches aimed at replacing all 24 existing satellites over the next 10 years.\n\nThese new satellites offer a variety of enhancements over the existing ones. The most important part of this project is to simply replace them. Numerous reports are concerned that the existing network may begin to fail due to age. This will obviously remedy that.\n\nIn addition, these new satellites will provide a stronger, more accurate signal. Rather than the roughly 20 foot accuracy that you currently receive, the new ones will allow for accuracy down to about 3 feet. In addition, the stronger signal will help more GPS units to function properly indoors, which could be a big boost for various augmented reality tools that are beginning to find their way into the marketplace.\n\nYou can view the launch of the IIF SV-1 (aboard the Delta IV rocket) below:","createdDate":"2010-06-05T19:41:25.981Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-20T14:33:31.448Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/YKbKQv0lAfM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"never\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/YKbKQv0lAfM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"never\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>"},{"id":"544331:Video:18803","contributorName":"19k7v4w3d553u","title":"Road Bridge - Scan Data Aminmation","description":"Animation of 3D Laser scan data at road bridge in central london.","createdDate":"2010-05-24T20:54:33.090Z","updatedDate":"2018-07-12T08:12:44.413Z","approved":"Y","videoAttachmentUrl":"videos/125-tmp131867.flv","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:19232","contributorName":"19k7v4w3d553u","description":"Thanks Pete,\n\nActually, it was only 2 set ups!

Available tools include videos, interactive 3D Viewer files, and high-resolution images.","createdDate":"2009-02-18T02:37:50.125Z"}]},{"id":"544331:Video:6785","contributorName":"0aerehuak2l4u","title":"Trimble - Survey - Trimble Access Video","description":"Simply AMAZING.","createdDate":"2009-01-30T13:49:51.595Z","updatedDate":"2016-11-03T17:18:37.874Z","approved":"Y","videoAttachmentUrl":"videos/150-tmp43823.flv"},{"id":"544331:Video:6698","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"Survey Point #2 Angles to Bearings","description":"Convert angles to bearings in land surveying","createdDate":"2009-01-26T03:37:24.364Z","updatedDate":"2014-04-25T12:35:58.742Z","approved":"Y","embedCode":"<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/hVM2TPI4nGg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"never\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/hVM2TPI4nGg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"never\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>"},{"id":"544331:Video:6694","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"Palmetto Equipment and Supply","description":"A brief commercial about our company, Palmetto Equipment and Supply of Charleston.
