class=\"ember-view\"><div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"reader-article-content\"><p>On this day in 1998, my life changed. While working as a land surveyor out in the Charleston Tea Farm (then overgrown for over 30 years and not surveyed since the 50s).\u00a0</p>\n<address>Ravenel, South Carolina</address>\n<p></p>\n<p>I can remember the day as if it were yesterday... I had on chest waders and snake boots carrying a machete and a prism pole. After having already killed one water moccasin that morning with my bushaxe, I was asked to take center-line shots from the middle of a long canal once used as a track for carting tea from one section of the plantation to another. It was about 6 feet deep in some sections and 8-10 in others. While attempting to cross the canal I get a crackling on the radio. \"Jaybird, watch your left, there is a gator coming towards you.\" I thought it was a joke, but then i looked over and there sat the largest gator I have ever seen - 12-14ft. I froze. Radio again. \"Shit man, there is another one coming up behind you fast!\" I stepped into the water to try to cross. It was over my head and I sank with water pouring into my waders. Crew chief luckily had a shotgun in the truck. He let out a shot towards the bank and stopped both gators from coming into the water after me. I reached out of the water with my prism pole and stabbed it into the bank on the other side. Low and behold there was a third gator already in the water making its way towards me. With his last shotgun shell, he shot the water right beside me and the gator stopped. I climbed out of the canal with my life. The next day, I quit surveying and enrolled in College of Charleston and took a job as a bellman at Planters Inn. The rest is history.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This was my 2nd of 5 near death experiences over the years.<span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>It wasn't until some years later that I began building Land Surveyors United and trying to use the power of social media to promote awareness and connectivity among surveyors...</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong><u>Food for thought:</u></strong><span>\u00a0</span><em>If you think your job sucks, just think of what land surveyors encounter every single day to make measurements that society can rely on.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For Those Land Surveyors out there who have similar stories to share, please consider composing a short story on<span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blog/list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Land Surveyors United Surveyor Stories</a><span>\u00a0</span>so we can all learn what surveying is like in your part of the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Charleston Tea Plantation Today:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQEqp0HdV6MfaQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1551916800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=0JKBCANgz_by30rN5_Bv9sDyKmFi_Jg7kpCrrNCJ88c\"/></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reader-flag-content__wrapper mb4 clear-both\"></div>\n<div class=\"reader-flag-content__wrapper mb4 clear-both\"></div>\n<div class=\"reader-flag-content__wrapper mb4 clear-both\">Do you have any particularly interesting stories about why you began or have quit surveying in the past?\u00a0 We'd love for you to share them with us!</div>","createdDate":"2019-01-02T22:25:02.756Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-17T23:27:19.645Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2019-01-02T22:25:02.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:447590","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","description":"<p>Wow... that's pretty scary situation...</p>","createdDate":"2019-01-04T23:17:12.893Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:447103","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Best of  the Best from 2018 -

There are very few available records of the existing water distribution network and as such extensive field investigations and detailed field surveying will be required to confirm pipe locations and coordinates, routings, depths, sizes, materials and condition and similar information for valves, hydrants, cleanouts, reducers, customer connections, etc. Other major water supply system components such as intakes, treatment plants, storage reservoirs, pumping stations will also be surveyed and mapped. After field verification and surveying, information will be inputted into a GIS, overlaid on satellite imagery. The latest available technologies for cloud-based information transfer to the GIS should be used. The GIS will include all pertinent information on the piping network and other water system assets. A coding system will need to be developed to have a unique identifier for each component of the system. Once the GIS is setup, custom tools will be developed to aid the water utility with ongoing operation and maintenance activities. Data from the GIS will need to be exportable to other programs for use in O&amp;M activities and water network modelling. Training of utility staff in the field investigation and surveying techniques and the use of the GIS will be carried out to enable ongoing use of the systems developed under the project. Ongoing intermittent technical support on the use of the GIS system will be provided after delivery of the completed GIS to the Client.<br/>Job Description: Duties and Responsibilities will include but not be limited to:<br/>\u2022 Coordinate all activities of the project team comprising field investigation teams, surveyors, GIS experts, civil engineering and network modelling personnel.<br/>\u2022 Review all existing available project documentation and reports to develop a thorough understanding of the extent of the existing distribution network and water supply system assets, and with input from others on the team, develop a detailed strategy and implementation plan<br/>for the project, with weekly targets for all team members and including quality control measures for field work and data input.<br/>\u2022 Assess capacities of utility staff that are to receive training and develop capacity building and training plans for these staff including the preparation of training materials.<br/>\u2022 Take the leading role in preparing all reports, documents, and project deliverables including monthly progress reports to the Client and weekly reporting as requested by company management.<br/>\u2022 Take the leading role in coordinating, preparing, and delivering presentations at stakeholder workshops and Client meetings.<br/>\u2022 Directly supervise all project team members including project administrative and support personnel to ensure that all work of the project team is performed to a high degree of quality, according to the project implementation plan and budget.<br/>\u2022 Serve as the key day-to-day contact with the Client, and forge a close working relationship with the Client, keeping the Client informed of all project team activities and constraints.<br/>\u2022 Follow up with the Client to obtain any necessary project information and/or decisions.<br/>\u2022 Keep company management informed of project progress, constraints, issues requiring resolution, and project financial aspects on a weekly basis through written reports and phone/video conferences as requested by management.<br/>\u2022 Prepare project team work plans and financial budgets based on the work plan (monthly, quarterly and yearly) for approval by company management.<br/>\u2022 Monitor progress against work plans and update regularly.<br/>\u2022 Approve project team expenditures and monitor actual expenditures against budget.<br/>Base of Operations and Travel: The project team including the Team Leader will be based full-time on site in Nigeria.

It gives businesses the opportunity to deduct the FULL purchase price of qualifying new/used equipment and software bought and used during the tax year they were purchased or financed. The tax incentive encourages small businesses to invest in themselves and purchase equipment now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The deduction is up to $1,000,000 for 2018, which means businesses can deduct the full cost of equipment from their 2018 taxes with a \u201ctotal equipment purchased for the year\u201d threshold of $2,500,000. Most small and medium businesses will benefit by taking the deduction, but in order to qualify, the equipment must be purchased and put into service by 11:59pm, 12/31/2018.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For more details, please contact your tax professional. <a href=\"https://www.agsgps.com/section179/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The calculator</a> is only designed to give an estimate based on qualifying purchases made during the 2018 tax year.\u00a0 If you would like to speak with a representative of Advanced Geodetic Surveys, look no further than the ever helpful <a href=\"https://landsurveyorsunited.com/profile/LucasDuda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lucas Duda here on the network</a>.\u00a0 Reach out and ask questions.... by all means take advantage of this opportunity.</p>","createdDate":"2018-12-05T23:49:23.887Z","updatedDate":"2018-12-23T08:16:38.927Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2018-12-05T23:49:23.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:444953","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","description":"<p>You can also take advantage of the savings by taking a look at some of the incredible <a href=\"http://equipment.srvyr.com/content/home/2085#search/latest/none/all/6257/all/1/1/latest/40/0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deals AGS has on equipment in the Equipment Hunter site</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://equipment.srvyr.com/content/home/2085#search/latest/none/all/6257/all/1/1/latest/40/0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://storage.ning.com/topology/rest/1.0/file/get/242395365?profile=original\" class=\"align-center\" width=\"100%\"/></a></p>","createdDate":"2018-12-06T01:19:01.180Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:444980","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Current Top 100 Land Surveying Blogs To Read","description":"<p>Some things relevant to <strong>land surveying</strong> change very quickly, such as technology, shortages in the workforce, etc..\u00a0 We can look to blogs authored by land surveyors to help guide us through those changes.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://storage.ning.com/topology/rest/1.0/file/get/222251677?profile=original\" class=\"align-full\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Top 100 Land Surveying Blogs\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here are the current <strong>Top 100 Land Surveying blogs</strong> based on Search Engine Ranking and Social Shares..</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"css-1do16w7\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"css-1do16w7\"><div class=\"css-ev721i\"><div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQKFcqwffcCmTi_shhcDssCsvDDUSY2aQjllLiY6g5f_X-ex8xOfq9ibAWoIT39bOVnLKCy1TKLnpRk/pubhtml\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nDo you author a land surveying blog?

The board provides that opportunity. That\u2019s its greatest value.\u201d</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here at Land Surveyors United, the goals of community solidarity and potential for learning are not only tremendous, they are endless.\u00a0 As a true social community, our greatest value can be found in the next thing you share with your fellow surveyors.\u00a0 One of the many differences between RPLS Network and Land Surveyors United is of course that we are an <a href=\"https://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/members/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Community of Land Surveyors</a>.\u00a0 It can be said that although some land surveyors prefer to network only with other surveyors from their region, we have always felt that an international community provides the highest learning potential in the modern age.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I can't help but wonder if Mr. Deal would have extended the reach of his community worldwide if he were still around.\u00a0 The RPLS Network will truly be missed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you to POB Magazine and Mark Deal, RPLS (1963-2002) for providing such a valuable resource for land surveyors for so many years.\u00a0 Your shoes will never be filled.</p>","createdDate":"2018-11-21T20:12:36.847Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-12T14:20:31.968Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2018-11-21T20:12:36.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:447242","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"<p>RPLS.com went completely off the rails after Mark Deal passed away.

The level at the crown of the pipe is the Invert level plus the internal diameter of the pipe plus the pipe wall thickness. Don\u2019t let your rod get crooked. The InvertBoot solves the age-old surveyor\u2019s issue of recording the invert on a culvert or drain without the need to angle your surveying rod. The InvertBoot has been created to be easily fitted on the foot of the most popular Grade Rods such as the Crain SVR 25-Foot Fiberglass Grade Rod. With the InvertBoot the Surveying or pipe laying technician can find the invert on as-built Infrastructure, Drainage &amp; sanitary surveying projects as wells as new development land surveying projects. InvertBoot is a professional grade tool that will stand up to daily commercial use. If your project demands accurate, high-quality land surveying equipment that can help find the invert, InvertBoot is the tool to use. InvertBoot is commercial grade surveying equipment that is much needed in the industry.</p>\n<div class=\"ecwid ecwid-SingleProduct-v2 ecwid-SingleProduct-v2-bordered ecwid-SingleProduct-v2-centered ecwid-Product ecwid-Product-116700578\"><div></div>\n<div class=\"ecwid-title\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"ecwid-productBrowser-price ecwid-price\"><div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p>Contact: GM David Kelley 772-342-6844</p>","createdDate":"2018-09-28T20:07:18.494Z","updatedDate":"2018-09-28T20:07:18.494Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"draft","publishTime":"2018-09-28T20:07:18.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:438466","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Resumes On Air - Live Video Cover Letters for Land Surveyors","description":"<p>Next week we are going to try something new on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/149432412669303/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SurveyingJobs page</a> for <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/category/seeking-employment\" target=\"_self\">Land Surveyors who are looking for employment</a>.

href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/group/portugal-land-surveyors\" target=\"_self\">Portugal Land Surveyors</a> which you might like to join and ask more specific questions inside that forum.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This site has some information on <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/pt/land-use-state-and-impacts-portugal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Land Use in Portugal</a></p>\n<p class=\"Default\">In 2006, a total of 71\u00a0% of continental Portugal was given over to forest and agriculture and approximately 15\u00a0% was a mixture of agriculture and natural areas. Artificial surfaces represented 3.5\u00a0% and natural vegetation 8.6\u00a0% of land cover (IGP, 2009). In spite of land use modifications, the overall distribution remains comparable to that registered in 2000. Forests and areas of natural vegetation continue to dominate land cover in continental Portugal and remain the focus of the most dynamic modifications.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Although tracts of forest land have been converted to other uses, new forests have also been planted. Between 2000 and 2006, there was a net increase of 30 000 hectares in forest cover. In contrast, areas covered by natural vegetation declined by 27 000 hectares or 3.5\u00a0% (APA, 2009).</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Water bodies are one of the land use types which have registered the largest growth: a total of 18\u00a0000 hectares between 2000 and 2006. The increase in artificial surfaces is continuing on the upward trajectory it has been following since 1986, mostly at the expense of agriculture areas. This also contributes to the generalised and increasing trend of soil sealing. Between 2000 and 2006, this class increased by 10\u00a0%, mainly as a result of disperse urbanisation, a common trait in the Portuguese landscape.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\"></p>\n<p class=\"Default\">This document may be some help as well..<a href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/y4jxilOpMUQggzel0GDcnYFKcHSFQNLK91oGuYLH*v2SNaKLDD1w*GK9Bm-sLgfl6UJrN4DtwjpFNlu0FIJnPotsHhdCuepd/Informal_note_1_v2.pdf\" target=\"_self\">Informal_note_1_v2.pdf</a></p>\n<p></p>","createdDate":"2018-05-16T23:47:50.448Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:425214","contributorName":"27ozny4w4tpeq","title":"Surveying & Mapping Awareness","description":"<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">GeoMap Society (GEMS) established in 1990 has been conducting programmes forcreating awareness about importance of Surveying &amp; Mapping.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">On 10 April 2018, National Survey Day in India,seminar and Survey Quiz was held at JNT University Hyderabad.\u00a0National Survey Day is celebrated every year in India to commemorate the measurement of the first Baseline of Great Trigonometric Survey (GTS) on 10<sup>th</sup> April 1802 near Chennai, Tamilnadu</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">For more details, send email to Maj Siva Kiran, Secretary GEMS at\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">geomapsociety@gmail.com\u00a0</span></p>","createdDate":"2018-05-12T07:38:46.735Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-22T21:29:53.681Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2018-05-12T07:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:424852","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Land Surveyor Luncheon Survey Field Technician Training Program at Pinellas Technical College","description":"<div>Plans for <span>Survey Field Technician Training Program at Pinellas Technical College is moving\u00a0</span>full speed ahead, developing the Survey Field Technician program at Pinellas Technical College and you're invited.\u00a0 Our IDA-WDT (Industry Driven Approach to Workforce Development Training) gives you a seat at the table and we're interested in hearing what you have to say.\u00a0 Come out and tour our campus, speak with curriculum developers and much more.\u00a0</div>\n<div>Please RSVP to Mr. Rohland Bryant because our Culinary Arts Department is preparing a lunch just for you on<span>\u00a0</span><span class=\"aBn\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Wednesday May 23, 2018 from 11:00 until 1:00 p.m.</span></span>\u00a0 \u00a0</div>\n<div><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rohland Bryant</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Outreach Liaison &amp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secretary of Public Works Academy<br/> <br/> Pinellas Technical College</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">901 34<sup>th</sup><span>\u00a0</span>Street South</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">St. Petersburg, FL\u00a0 33711</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/> <a href=\"mailto:bryantro@pcsb.org\"><span>bryantro@pcsb.org</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">727.893.2500 ext. 2589 (Office)</p>\n</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>We welcome all industry professionals to attend so please feel free to share this flyer.\u00a0\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/193178597981556/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RSVP for Event on Facebook</a></span></div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/193178597981556/\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/dNuc-C7AIuVMuXGVh3dszRvqOEOheNZiclToLA3Yt7fv39v5rXY1YH7E2cyQzq1LG3nlRIHqic*Q-2sBfDirDieIj61j3KyD/PTCSurveyFieldTechnicianluncheonMay23rd2018.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"align-full\"/></a></div>","createdDate":"2018-05-08T17:39:49.005Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-16T15:05:32.798Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2018-05-08T17:39:48.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:423693","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Never Again Pay Too Much for Survey Company Gear","description":"<p><em>Tired of trying to find a reliable company to order custom shirts, hats, safety vests and company gear?</em> Here is Something New and Special for all of you Land Surveyors United members out there.

I really wanted to know in term of standard deviation what would be the \"end results\".</strong></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The solution was to propagate the variances (standard deviation squared) into the functional model (the mathematical formula in short) and to retrieve the results I was looking for.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">By taking the formula to determine the surface of a polygon, we have the coordinates of all points.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">By differentiating that equation vs point's coordinates, we can assimilate (at the first order) the derivates dx, dy to the standard deviation of course squared.

By fixing 2 prisms on a pole and kept it steady, you can determine the coordinates of a hidden point.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">At that time we suggested using a dynamic approach (with a 360\u00b0 prism) where the operator had to move around the hidden point the pole and having all the 3D positions of the prism to solve the problem considering a spherical fit approach. You can get the centre of the sphere and a check on the pole length.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">We can use the same approach with a GNSS pole. Instead of using a tilt meter and a digital compass (as you do need to align the tilt meter) or a smart combination of a GNSS board and a IMU, why not to move your pole keeping the bottom fixed on the point ?</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Practically you engage an automatic collection of points using a spacing of 10 or 25 cm and you keep moving ... All the coordinates will fit a sphere around the point ! You can use a direct linear approach to solve the equations.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A nice variant would be to measure the same way, but by using different pole height. In that case you need to have at least 3 positions with your GNSS pole (1,6 m 1,8 m and 2,0 m). You are just replicating the fundamental navigation problem of GNSS as your receiver will look like \"satellites\" orbiting around your point and the pseudo range will be your pole length.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">That's the \"Software Free Bubble\" method.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Is it working well ?

So we are talking about short traverses that must be deployed in urbanized areas and anywhere we cannot simply use GNSS ...\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The directions/angles resection has been replaced by \"Free Station\" method taking advantage we are measuring distance so easily today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So it's time to left the \"good old\" traverse method and consider a new approach that will be more flexible, faster and more accurate not only to deploy on the field but also delivering results on the fly.</p>\n<p>Since 1987, we worked on that (we even put a patent on that new approach around 2006) and I am very much interested to know your opinion about that !\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) From your professional point of vue and experience, what would be the key points a new method to survey (to replace the traverse way) should own ?\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) Are you looking for new fresh approach on your daily works that would help you to speed up or you are very much satisfied with the existing tools (that are now on-board Total Stations) ?</p>\n<p>3) Don't you think surveyors should take over such development instead of leaving it to producers ?</p>\n<p>4) Are you surveying in 2D, 1D or 3D ?\u00a0</p>\n<p>5) How user friendly should be the processing software for a new method replacing the traverse one ?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many thanks for your time and your feedback ...\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>","createdDate":"2018-01-27T16:29:42.506Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-13T01:46:16.646Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2018-01-27T16:29:42.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:413764","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Amazing Survey Markers Around the World","description":"<p>With <a href=\"http://surveyearth.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Survey Earth in a Day</a> just around the corner again, knowing where your local markers are will come in handy when deciding where to submit a point from.

This particular Land Survey was extremely complex and difficult but I thought you might get a kick out of seeing how this is done. The names and other information have been altered to protect the innocent.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>SURVEYOR S REPORT</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>DISCUSSION</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>The parent tract of the subject tract was originally described by Deed to Weldon L. Wells August 31, 1955 recorded in Volume 3014, Page 724 of the Deed Records of Harris County, Texas. The subject tract was originally severed from the parent tract by vesting Deed from Weldon L. Wells to Wells Brothers Garage, Inc. dated February 3, 1963 recorded in Volume 5019, Page 165 of the Deed Records of Harris County, Texas and contains the controlling deed element call \u201cbeing the North 65 ft. of the same property described ... Vol. 3014, Page 724 of the Harris County Deed Records.\u201d This controlling deed element call conflicts with other locative elements of the subject tract vesting Deed (the bearing calls) but this Land Surveyor believes it reflects the true intent of the conveyance made.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>The ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey prepared by this Land Surveyor is based on the vesting deed description of the subject tract recorded in Volume 5019, Page 165 of the Deed Records of Harris County, Texas. Calls shown on this survey are calls from this originally severed description of the subject tract. The description of the subject tract in the Title Commitment provided was ignored by this Land Surveyor and is recited for purposes of transparency in Attachment \u201cA\u201d to this ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey, under the heading \u201cProvided Description.\u201d</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>The approximate remainder tract of the parent tract was subsequently conveyed by Weldon L. to Dohnalik and Gregory dated September 30, 1976 and recorded in Harris County Clerk\u2019s File No. E906316. This means the approximate remainder tract to the south of the subject tract is junior to the subject tract. Harris County Clerk\u2019s File No. E906316 contains the deed element call \u201cbeing the South 73.2 ft. of that same property described....Vol. 3014, Page 724 of the Harris County Deed Records.\u201d However, in this case, you cannot sell what you do not own. It is presumed that the intent of this instrument was to convey whatever land was left out of the parent tract after the subject tract conveyance, recorded in Volume 5019, Page 165 of the Deed Records of Harris County, Texas.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>The north line and the south line of the parent tract are not parallel. There is enough length along the west side (Oak Forest Drive side) of the parent tract to accommodate the distance calls for the subject tract and the approximate remainder tract. However, there is not enough length along the east line of the parent tract to accommodate the distance calls of the subject tract and the approximate remainder tract. The subject tract description and the approximate remainder tract of the parent tract description overlap as a result, creating a triangular area of record confusion. There is no overlap at the west end of the triangular area of record confusion and 7.55 feet of overlap on the east end of the triangular area of record confusion.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Various descriptions have been written for the subject tract and the approximate remainder tract since their original conveyances and filed for Public Record. The subject tract chain of title containing those descriptions is as follows:</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Wells Brothers Garage, Inc. to Richard W.

Sallar Varela Holdings, LP was the owner of the subject tract at that time and unfortunately an attempt was made by them along with Mecoop Designs, LLC to fix the triangular area of record confusion resulting in a conveyance from Mecoop Designs, LLC to Sallar Varela Holdings, LP, for a 286 square foot triangular strip of land, dated August 14, 2017 recorded in Harris County Clerk\u2019s File No. RP-2017-366763, being a triangular strip south of the northerly line of the apparent triangular area of record confusion.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>This conveyance of the triangular strip was only for a portion of the apparent triangular area of record confusion leaving an additional 579 square foot (more or less) triangular area of record confusion unresolved. The triangular strip out of the triangular area of record confusion was conveyed by Sallar Varela Holdings, LP to Michael Ralph Mress and Shaniece O.\u2019Rear Mress as Tract 2 in Harris County Clerk\u2019s File No. RP-2017-409319.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>CONCLUSIONS</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>The subject tract is senior to the approximate remainder tract and has superior written title to the 579 square foot (more or less) triangular area of record confusion left unresolved by the conveyance of the 286 square foot triangular tract of land described in Harris County Clerk\u2019s File No. RP-2017-366763. Surveys of the subject tract dated September 9, 2016 and the approximate remainder tract dated November 12, 2009, performed by Flybynight Surveyors (a.k.a. Fly By Night Land Surveying) and provided to this Land Surveyor, are in error, overlap and fail to explain how material discrepancies and conflicts in the record instruments depicted on those surveys were resolved. Further, these surveys fail to conform to the intent of the original conveyances of the parcels of land in question and generally do not meet the minimum standards set forth in Codified Law for Land Surveys performed in the State of Texas.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>WARNINGS, OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>It is necessary to consider possession, equity and other factors to determine the true boundary between the subject tract and the approximate remainder tract and the power to judge those matters does not reside with this Land Surveyor. Any agreement or judgement as to the location of the true boundary between the subject tract and the approximate remainder tract should fix the location of that line (unlike the apparent attempt to eliminate the problem in Harris County Clerk\u2019s File No. RP-2017-366763).</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>It could be argued that the conveyance in Harris County Clerk\u2019s File No. RP-2017-366763 in fact did fix the true boundary line between the subject tract and the approximate remainder tract but the instrument does not expressly provide the Public with this information. Extrinsic evidence would be needed, in this Land Surveyor\u2019s opinion, to prove that. If such an argument prevailed, this would make the true boundary between the subject tract and the approximate remainder tract located along the southerly line of the 286 square foot tract of land described in Harris County Clerk\u2019s File No. RP-2017-366763, contrary to the results of this survey.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Land Surveyor recommends the owner of the subject tract and the owner of the approximate remainder tract form an agreement as to the location of the true boundary line between them and such agreement then be reduced to writing and filed for Public Record.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the Land Surveyors who performed the previous surveys (within the last ten years) on the subject tract and the approximate remainder tract, could be held financially and professionally responsible for the problems with the boundaries outlined in this Surveyor\u2019s Report. A Professional Land Surveyor competent in matters of Land Surveyor negligence should be consulted before such recourse is considered.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>This Land Surveyor is not a Lawyer and any advice perceived as legal in nature, given above, should be viewed in that light. The advice of this Land Surveyor is that of a layman who is not competent concerning matters of Law.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Job No. H59595</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Preliminary, this document shall not be recorded for any purpose and shall not be used, viewed or relied upon as a final survey document.</span></p>\n<p><span>_____________________</span></p>\n<p><span>Deward Karl Bowles RPLS No. 4966</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>This report is based on the ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey and plat made by Deward Karl Bowles, Registered Professional Land Surveyor No. 4966, on January 9, 2018</span></p>","createdDate":"2018-01-14T21:15:33.015Z","updatedDate":"2018-11-24T04:43:20.732Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2018-01-14T21:15:32.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:414534","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"<p><span>Here is a letter we got back from our client after we finished the project.

Graduated","description":"<p></p>\n<p>You\u2019re on your way to a successful graduation and you\u2019re thinking about your next step. It\u2019s completely natural, we\u2019ve all been there. What\u2019s scary though is the notion of having to fight for your place in the market that\u2019s full of your peers and <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/successful-people-share-their-best-advice-for-new-college-grads-2015-5\">newly graduated</a> colleagues. So how can you stand out from the crowd and get a good job even though you\u2019ve barely graduated?</p>\n<p><b>Don\u2019t put yourself in a corner</b></p>\n<p>Even though you may be a major in graphic design, don\u2019t look specifically for graphic design opportunities. It\u2019s important to realize that in today\u2019s world, many occupations are actually combinations of different sets of skills. If you find a perfect job opportunity, go through the application, submit your resume, but don\u2019t stop there. Look for other employers and job positions as well. Digging yourself into a hole of waiting for a response from a single employer will get you nowhere fast. Make sure that you always think about the next step.</p>\n<p><b>Spruce up your skill set</b></p>\n<p>Employers these days like nothing more than to see leadership and teamwork as their employee\u2019s skills. This means that you should attend a seminar or two, volunteer, and be involved in community projects and clubs. Not only will this <a href=\"http://www.briantracy.com/blog/business-success/career-advice-tips-for-recent-college-graduates/\">help your resume and interview</a>, but also paint a picture of a responsible and bright young mind that any employer would love to have. The wider your skill set is, the better chances you have. Soft skills are a rare commodity that many people overlook during their studies \u2013 but they are just as important as your degree.</p>\n<p><b>Write a proper resume</b></p>\n<p>The first thing your employer will see when they consider you is the paperwork you submitted. Your resume is just as important as your motivational letter, since those are your tickets to an actual interview. If you\u2019re unsure about how to write these papers properly or translate it to another language, here is translation service <a href=\"https://thewordpoint.com/\">the word point</a> that you may want to consider. Make sure that you are honest and forward-thinking with these papers, because more often than not, employers don\u2019t even contact a person who is disqualified from the start.</p>\n<p><b>Research your employer</b></p>\n<p>The worst mistake you can make as a fresh graduate is to jump the shark and take the first chance you get. This is how you end up with a job you hate and wish you never contacted the company in the first place. Make sure that you are certain that a specific employer would be someone that you can actually work with. There\u2019s no shame in taking the first chance you get, but this is your time and energy we are talking about. Before making any commitments, be sure that you are both satisfied with one another and ready for a long-term cooperation.</p>\n<p><b>Consult people around you</b></p>\n<p>Even though you might not be on best terms with your family or professors, they care about you and are willing to help you. Don\u2019t make any decisions without consulting someone else. Your own opinion is subjective and it\u2019s easy to make a mistake because of a simple <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/6-career-tips-for-new-graduates.html\">lack of experience</a>. Try to avoid these problems by talking to someone older and wiser instead \u2013 it\u2019s less painful than quitting and regretting your job decisions.</p>\n<p><b>Prepare for the interview</b></p>\n<p>Once you actually get a call and an interview invitation, it\u2019s time to do some real homework. Your employer will appreciate if you know a few things <a href=\"http://www.managementstudyguide.com/tips-for-fresh-graduates-entering-the-corporate-world.htm\">about the company</a> history and what their ultimate mission is. Prepare for questions about your personal motivation, why you want to work at this specific position and what makes you different than other people.</p>\n<p>Like we\u2019ve said before, interviewers like nothing more than a healthy combination of positivity and ambition. The best thing you can do is be yourself. If you are fit for the company, that will be enough. If not, it\u2019s better for both parties if you didn\u2019t pass the interview, because it will only lead you to problems down the line.</p>\n<p><b>Be patient</b></p>\n<p>The hardest step in looking for your first employment will be staying patient. College rarely prepares us for what\u2019s really out there, because the market is merciless and the economy is fluctuating on a daily basis. You might find your first job fairly easily \u2013 or it might take months. There\u2019s no shame in compromising in the end, since dream jobs are hard to come by and usually require you to sacrifice big parts of your life. Make sure that you stay positive and don\u2019t give up your search. Your future employer is looking for someone just like you \u2013 so go and find them.</p>\n<p>When all is said and done, being yourself, and being responsible and respectful towards everyone around you is the best thing you can do. Even if you don\u2019t pass an interview, it\u2019s not the end of the world. It just means that that particular position wasn\u2019t meant for you. Keep moving forward and don\u2019t think about passed chances. If you\u2019re meant to be employed by someone special, it will take time and effort until you two actually meet. Until then, keep <a href=\"http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/graduate-job-no-experience/\">building your skill set</a> and don\u2019t give up trying \u2013 there\u2019s always light at the end of the tunnel.</p>","createdDate":"2017-09-29T15:33:32.041Z","updatedDate":"2019-01-29T17:22:12.618Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2017-09-29T15:33:31.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:398045","contributorName":"1a771lgn0x3yq","description":"<p>Good advice, to all young Surveyor or anyone else.</p>","createdDate":"2017-09-29T19:51:04.866Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:398035","contributorName":"2zoszkny7pprr","title":"I want help","description":"<p><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Hello</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Calibri\"><font size=\"3\">I am using Trimble R10 GPS\u00a0</font> <font size=\"3\">receiver anTSC3 data logger and Trimble Access soft ware.</font> <font size=\"3\">\u00a0</font><font size=\"3\">I will grateful if any one help me</font><font size=\"3\">\u00a0</font> <font size=\"3\">on this.

It\u2019s a real concern, given the nature of the world today. And yet, we love it, and we continue to transport ourselves around the world for those new experiences.</p>\n<p>There are some things we cannot control, no matter where we are. A pickpocket may target us; we might eat in a \u201cquestionable\u201d place, drink the water, and end up with some serious intestinal issues; we might even be the victim of a more serious crime. Those of us who travel a lot or for long periods of time to think about <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2015/02/19/safety-tips/23617237/\">safety issues</a>. But the desire for the experience outweighs those concerns.</p>\n<p>Still, there are things that we can do to improve our safety odds. Here is a checklist of safety tips that all travelers can use.<br/><a href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SAsLWER7F0m761RNUqL5kjYlQg6QArDtE12Gq57B1b89oKZ92dCLH5Z2M-LjoEVv*wOw1yEruLb*tPwT31XGSglHeSdQnU3d/pexelsphoto461789.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/SAsLWER7F0m761RNUqL5kjYlQg6QArDtE12Gq57B1b89oKZ92dCLH5Z2M-LjoEVv*wOw1yEruLb*tPwT31XGSglHeSdQnU3d/pexelsphoto461789.jpeg?width=750\" width=\"750\" class=\"align-full\"/></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Let Your Bank Know Where You Are Going</b><br/>Your bank pays more attention to you than you would believe, and one thing that causes distress during a trip is to find that your debit card has been disabled. Why does this happen? Once again, your bank pays a lot of attention to you, and your purchases. Specifically, where you purchase items. If you live in southern Georgia and your bank sees that you are making a purchase in London, it may assume that someone has hacked your information. And so, that purchase is denied and the card disabled. Always let your bank know if you plan to travel, where you will be, and how long you will be there. This is especially true for overseas travel.</li>\n<li><b>Don\u2019t Travel Alone<br/></b> While traveling by yourself can be a lot of fun. there are many risks to it. After all, you are a much easier target by yourself. If you want to stay safe, plan trips, especially longer ones and those to foreign destinations, with a friend or two. Barring that, perhaps sign up for a <a href=\"http://www.independenttraveler.com/travel-tips/specialty-travel/single-travel-tips-for-going-solo\">tour group</a>. You can always veer off from the group for unique experiences you may want.</li>\n<li><b>Choose Your Vehicle Wisely<br/></b> Choosing a good vehicle is a must for a trip, after all the only way one can find adventure is by traveling by car. Of course, the <a href=\"http://www.backpacking4beginners.com/downloads/travel-safety-101/\">type of car</a> matters, which is why you should always look at the key features such as the year it was made, how many airbags it possesses, what the blind spots are like, along with many other details. By looking thoroughly into these you can find a safe and reliable vehicle.</li>\n<li><b>Be Sure to Thoroughly Research Your Destination<br/></b> <br/>Today, it is incredibly easy to research destinations in order to ensure that you are traveling to savory places in the world. Almost everything has reviews and website ratings<b>.</b> Simply take the time to research those before you finally decide on your destination. And you can know up front what specific spots are considered unsavory or risky, so you can avoid them. After deciding the place of destination learns the few basic phrases in the official language. You don\u2019t need to learn it fluently or to write with perfect grammar like on <a href=\"https://www.getacademichelp.com/\">academic writing service</a>, but if you know how to say \u201cHello!\u201d or \u201cHow much?\u201d your trip will be easier and safer for sure.</li>\n<li><b>Keeping Your Valuables Safe<br/></b> We\u2019ve all heard the stories of people coming back to their hotel rooms only to discover the money they left in the dresser drawer, or that portable game system they bought for their kids has mysteriously gone missing. It would be rare that they are ever found. Make use of the hotel safe, and get a receipt for anything you put in that safe, with clear itemization. And before you go, purchase a separate travel insurance policy that will cover valuable jewelry you take.</li>\n<li><b>Invest in a Travel Safe/Body Pouch</b><br/>If you do have the money for a <a href=\"https://www.travelguard.com/whybuy/whytravelguard.asp\">travel safe</a>, buy one. These safes can easily fit into a suitcase and tend to be much more secure than taking all of our valuables with you. Just make certain that you store the safe and its contents in a safe location in your hotel room, in order to make it less likely for possible thieves to try and decipher the code you assign to it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Body pouches that are housed inside your clothing can hold large sums of cash and your passport. Never leave a passport in a hotel room. And if you are going to be in a foreign country for a long time, storing it at your country\u2019s consulate is always a good option.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Only Take What You Need</b><br/>While you may be tempted to go into town with all your money and credit cards, if something were to happen you would be completely out of luck. Instead, keep your daily needs and expenses to just what you will need. You will be able to have a great time shopping in town with nothing more than 60$ cash and one credit card.</li>\n<li><b>Don\u2019t be Quick to Trust the People You Meet</b><br/>While you can meet great people during travels, and while many of them can become wonderful friends in the future, under no circumstances should you trust a person as soon as you meet them? Many thieves have learned to use a traveler\u2019s trusting instincts to their advantage. Even if they seem like the nicest people on earth, do not leave them alone with your stuff. There is a chance that when you get back they, and your valuables, will be gone.</li>\n<li><b>Blend in as Much as You Can</b><br/>If you want to attract pickpockets, you dress as differently as you can. This shows that you do not know the area, and you are more likely to be taken advantage of. Remember to do your research in advance and purchase/pack the type of clothing that looks natural and normal for your destination(s).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>10. <b>Be Mindful How You Carry Yourself</b></p>\n<p>Sometimes, safety on the streets is a matter of how you \u201ccarry\u201d yourself. If you \u201clook\u201d timid or \u201clost,\u201d you are considered a much easier target to criminals. Walk confidently, with a deliberate stride, great posture, and as if you know exactly where you are going. Hooligans will look for another target.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>11. <b>Prepare for the Worst</b><br/>There is an old saying that goes, \u201cHope for the best, but prepare for the worst.\u201d While you are hoping for the perfect vacation, it is best to assume that something bad could happen along the way. Your purse or wallet could be stolen; you might require a trip to the hospital, or your hotel could lose your reservation. You need a plan, access to emergency funds, and an investment in travel insurance.</p>\n<p>Remember that while there is no universal plan for safety for every place in the world, there are many similar factors between them all. Remember to plan, research, and above all be smart about where you go, how you go, and what you do with your valuables. Above all, be mindful of your surroundings and take precautions to guard your health.</p>","createdDate":"2017-09-28T16:18:51.574Z","updatedDate":"2018-12-02T01:43:39.991Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2017-09-28T16:18:51.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:398121","contributorName":"23y8klfgvl85e","title":"Tersus GNSS showcases its innovative RTK solutions, at InterGEO 2017, Berlin","description":"<p>Berlin, September 26, 2017 - Tersus GNSS Inc.

I still use Autocad 13 with Softdesk 7.6...so I have to keep a fresh supply of Windows XP operating systems around. Although I have all the modules there is for Softdesk I only use about 5%. Sticking with what works for me keeps my overhead down to zero. That, to me, is the object of the game.</p>","createdDate":"2017-09-26T22:07:34.625Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:395929","contributorName":"00c8gmn8ja7vz","title":"Show us yours and we'll show you ours!","description":"<p>We\u2019ll show you ours if you show us yours!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At KPI we know why you already use or really want a Robotic Total Station.

As to the Corruption and Degeneracy of Human Nature in general, I shall leave that Disquisition to the Pulpit, and consider it no further, than as it affects Society. And in this Respect, I cannot think it so universally depraved, as by the modern Practice it seems to be. There is no squaring Things in Politicks\u00a0<strong>according to Gunter</strong>; the Mathematicks will have no Share in our Measures; it is become a Piece of Pedantry to talk with Reason, or vote by Rule; and the Point in Question, is not the Justice of the Cause, but the Majority of Votes.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The phrase, however, seems to have become an Americanism. In\u00a0<em>Dictionary of Americanisms</em>\u00a0(2<sup>nd</sup> edition \u2013 Boston, 1859), the American historian and linguist John Russell Bartlett (1805-86) wrote:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">According to Gunter. Gunter was a distinguished arithmetician, and the inventor of a chain and scale for measuring. The Laws of Rhode Island, both colonial and recent, referring to measures, say, \u201cAll casks shall be gauged by the rule commonly called \u2018gauging by Gunter.\u2019\u201d Hence any thing correctly and properly done is said to be \u201c<strong>according to Gunter</strong>.\u201d</span><br/> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201cMr. K\u2014, a respected citizen of Detroit, has published a letter entirely exonerating General Cass from the charge of having defrauded his association in the land speculations. He is positive that all was done\u00a0<strong>according to Gunter</strong>.\u201d\u2014N. Y. Tribune.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And the following is from\u00a0<em>Americanisms\u2014Old &amp; New</em>\u00a0(London, 1889), compiled and edited by the British lexicographer John S. Farmer (1854-1916):</span></p>\n<blockquote><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Gunter, According to.\u2014A variant of the English \u201c<strong>According to Cocker</strong>.\u201d Both Gunter and Cocker were distinguished mathematicians; the former, however, being a Puritan, has naturally taken the lead in the United States in preference to the latter. In Canada, also, the phrase, \u2018<strong>according to Gunter</strong>,\u2019 holds its own almost exclusively. The expression, which was English before it became naturalized in America, signifies carefully and correctly done.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Not only was the expression \u201c<em>English before it became naturalized in America</em>\u201d but it was still in use in Britain in the 19<sup>th</sup>\u00a0century; for instance, the following is from the\u00a0<em>Berwick Advertiser</em>\u00a0(Northumberland) of Saturday 18<sup>th</sup>\u00a0January 1834:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ORIGINAL PAPERS.\u2014BY THE\u00a0EDITOR.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">SKETCHES, BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL, ON THE LITERARY CHARACTERS AND LITERATURE OF BRITAIN, FROM THE DAYS OF GOLDSMITH TO THE PRESENT TIME.</span><br/> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">[\u2026]</span><br/> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">THOMAS CAMPBELL.

However, if you use the right technology, the land surveying process can be a source of real business value for the project as a whole. By getting the project off on the right foot with high-quality land surveying services, you can set the foundation for a project that gets completed on time and within budget.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are one example of a technology that can help project leaders rethink land surveying. Read on to learn how UAV land surveying can be much more than just a time-consuming necessity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Save time</b></p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems that project managers have when it comes to traditional land surveying methods is that they can be so incredibly time-consuming. This, in turn, pushes back the date at which construction can begin, meaning that investors have more time to wait before the project starts providing a return.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>UAVs help address this issue by significantly speeding up the land surveying process. The fact is that traditional land surveyors aren't able to move particularly fast, which means it will take a lot of time for them to complete their work. For projects that cover vast areas, such as an oil and gas pipeline, the issue is compounded even further. In addition, the data these surveyors collect must be processed before it can be made available for use, leading to even longer delays.</p>\n<p>UAVs can move much quicker than traditional surveyors. They travel as the crow flies, completely unimpeded by obstacles on the ground that might take hours to cross otherwise. This allows UAVs to survey up to six square miles per day. The results of these surveys can also be turned around and ready to use in as little as 24 hours.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Slash costs</b></p>\n<p>Another important area of concern for project managers planning land surveys is that the high costs could put the entire project in the red before the construction work even begins. While it is true that traditional surveying methods can be a significant source of expenses early on in the project, land surveys that apply UAV technology can be completed at a small fraction of the cost.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.landpoint.net/a-look-at-how-oil-and-gas-surveying-is-becoming-less-expensive/\" target=\"_blank\">UAVs have grown increasingly affordable</a>\u00a0as the underlying technology continues to develop. While UAVs were initially used primarily for military applications, the new lower price points have made them increasingly feasible in a variety of new industry settings\u2014land surveying is just one prominent example.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition to being relatively inexpensive to acquire, UAV technology also provides lower operating costs than traditional land surveying technology. Of course, the fact that UAV surveying can be completed quickly by a single drone operator means that it requires fewer man hours than traditional surveying. As a result, you can use UAV technology to gather all the data you might need to support a quality project while also paying significantly less than you might have in the past.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Increase accuracy</b></p>\n<p>Ensuring a high level of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.landpoint.net/high-resolution-aerial-maps-how-detailed-are-they/\">precision and detail</a>\u00a0for your land surveying results can be a critical factor in getting your project off to the right start. If you base your project on suboptimal data, it could lead you to make incorrect assumptions when creating your project plan. In turn, this could result in expensive and time-consuming rework later on.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Getting the right data before the project begins can significantly decrease the likelihood that you\u2019ll experience one of those unpleasant surprises later on in the process. This is where UAVs can help. By pairing UAVs with the latest in data capture technology, such as high-definition cameras and 3D laser scanners, a land surveying team can provide the accuracy and detail that today\u2019s large construction projects demand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition, UAVs can fly over difficult terrain and place themselves in tight spots, meaning that they can capture accurate data even in areas that traditional land surveying teams might not be able to reach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Finding the right UAV land surveying partner</b></p>\n<p>While the potential benefits of UAV land surveying are clear, you need to make sure you work with the right service provider to fully take advantage of those benefits. For one, you want to find a partner that has the latest UAV surveying technology, and also has experienced and certified operators to get the best results out of that technology.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another important consideration is whether or not the service provider in question offers end-to-end land surveying services. Ideally, you would want to work with a single partner that could provide you with everything you need from a land surveying perspective: from collecting the initial data to processing it to storing it and then making it available for users across the organization. Getting all of these services from the same partner can streamline the land surveying process and provide you with a single, simple payment structure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Final thoughts</b></p>\n<p>It wasn't that long ago that most people considered drones the stuff of science fiction. The future is here, and the early adopters that take advantage of UAVs for their land surveying needs will ensure the best possible project results.</p>","createdDate":"2017-08-01T21:55:29.113Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-06T17:58:29.616Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2017-08-01T21:55:29.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:388251","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"Introducing America's Building Records","description":"<p>There is a box or drawer full of old plats, blueprints and survey drawings that are collecting dust somewhere at your surveying company.\u00a0 Why not scan them into a file archive and monetize them?\u00a0 Imagine being able to sell access to those old surveys, retain the rights and permissions and make money twice with them.\u00a0 This is exactly what\u00a0<a href=\"https://goo.gl/Q9jFgL\" target=\"_blank\">America's Building Records</a> is providing the construction industry- the ability to do just that.\u00a0 Land Surveyors United recently partnered with ABR and would like to tell you a little bit about this ground breaking service they offer.\u00a0 It could easily change the way you do business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goo.gl/Q9jFgL\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/78ZmM5luAMLUANdMk705bWkgV1fdwtRqP0MQ5q6KzhzgnaYMUflB5SQhOxX5bCUfoZ0qX9Ehcux2hGsx05nx1IgNA0zkjnbx/buildingrecords.us1.jpg\" class=\"align-full\" width=\"100%\"/></a><span class=\"font-size-4\"><strong>\u00a0National GIS Dedicated to Preserving Construction Documents</strong></span></p>\n<p>ABR is a National GIS for Building plans, allowing American construction professionals to Store Files, Quickly find files and share access to them for a fee (determined by you).

This means school is nearly always a concern for land surveyors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s where things can get complicated. Land surveying jobs often involve lots of travel, sometimes to remote locations. It\u2019s difficult for degreed land surveyors and other surveying crew members to pursue degrees or meet their continuing education requirements when they are in the field. Fortunately, there are several online programs that are perfect for people with distance learning needs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Everglades University - Bachelor\u2019s in Land Surveying Management</b></p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>Everglades University offers a Bachelor\u2019s of Science in Land Surveying Management. Graduates of the program may pursue careers in both construction, and roadway work. The program is available in a classroom or wholly online. Once they have graduated, students are prepared for entry-level positions as land surveyors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Students in the program are required to complete a total of 123 credit hours. In addition to taking basic academic courses including English, humanities, and science students take a wide array of career-relevant courses. The program is concluded with students taking a capstone course.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><b>McKissock Learning - Land Surveying Continuing Education</b></p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>As with many other fields, the land surveyor\u2019s education does not end when they receive their degree or certificate. Instead, they must complete continuing education requirements in order to remain qualified to work in their field. In many cases, continuing education is mandated and directed by the state, regulatory bodies. Mckissock provides both correspondence and online education for land surveyors in every state.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Classes available include those covering subjects such as:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eminent Domain</li>\n<li>Ethical Practices</li>\n<li>Standards of Conduct</li>\n<li>Legal Descriptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/floodplain-management\">Fema And Floodplain Management</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>McKissock learning offers classes to groups of land surveyors or individuals may sign up on their own.

This course of study can be completed in person or online. During the two-year program they will study, Subdivision Design, Computer Aided Design, Photogrammetry, Geographic Information Systems, Global Positioning Systems, and more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Students who select OKC may take advantage of the opportunity to become members of the Oklahoma Society of Land Surveyors.

They are available through correspondence study. Students may purchase textbooks or download a PDF version of the textbook. Once they have worked through the course materials, they simply use a link provided to them to take the final exam for that course. When they pass, they are provided with a certificate to print out. Courses may be purchased in bundles or one at a time. Students should strongly consider speaking with peers, reading a course <a href=\"http://www.topwritersreview.com/top-10-essay-writing-services/\">reviews page</a>, and verifying with their employer that any continuing education they are pursuing meets their needs.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><b>Great Basin College - Land Surveying/Geomatics</b></p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>Nevada-based Great Basin College has a land surveying and geomatics degree program for students. This program can be taken in person or online. Graduates completing the program will receive a Bachelors of Applied Science degree.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The program was developed in cooperation with the Nevada Association of Land Surveyors\u2019 advisory committee. It is specifically designed for students already working in the industry who do not have the ability to attend school in person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Students take a combination of core classes, humanities, and other academic courses so that they are critical thinking, well-rounded graduates. They are prepared to take and pass the Fundamentals of Land Surveying exam that is administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before graduation, students complete a capstone course. This is where they design and execute a surveying project. This project must be completed successfully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although Great Basin College is a four-year institution, they do offer an Associates of Applied Science degree in this discipline as well.

This means that those studying for a degree in civil engineering or related fields can enhance their education by adding this as a minor. The minor can also be attached to a major in organizational leadership. The school also offers a Cadastral Surveying Certificate. Surveyors with this certificate are the only people who are authorized by the <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/\">Bureau of Land Management</a> to survey federally lands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The school provides courses to the students through a series of pre-recorded lectures. Students also participate in weekly teleconferences. It should be noted that final exams are proctored.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The University of Wyoming has a cooperative agreement with Sheridan College. Students attending Sheridan can complete the majority of an associate's degree as distance learners. However, there are two courses that must be completed in person. This degree is fully transferable to the University of Wyoming.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Selecting an Online Program</b></p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>Before making a final decision about the online course of study they will pursue, students should investigate their options thoroughly. First, they should verify that the school they are planning to attend is legitimately accredited. Beware of for-profit schools that form their own accrediting bodies. Accreditation should come from a government body. Students seeking continuing education should be certain that their state approves of the courses provided so that they are sure they will meet all requirements.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>Land surveyors and future land surveyors certainly have a variety of options when it comes to distance learning.

I believe we understand Original Surveys pretty well. If we cut a parcel of land (subdivide) into any smaller parcel than the original we are conducting an original survey. That original could have been run in the 1780\u2019s or just last year. (Technically though, when we retrace the original boundary in preparation for subdivision, that is a Resurvey of the overall boundary.)</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">What I want to dwell on is the Resurvey. According to Faircloth,</span></p>\n<blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Resurveys of lands involve the retracement of lines or boundaries which have already been established or marked upon the ground by authorized persons at some prior time.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Further he adds</span></p>\n<blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">...the resurvey is almost solely for the purpose of retracing or again locating the very same original lines, corners or areas. The resurvey involves very little original work, if any, but does involve the execution of a great deal of judgement and intelligent reasoning in attempting to retrace the exact lines and areas of the original or old survey. (my emphasis added)</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2026 In a resurvey it is the function of the surveyor to find where the monuments, courses, lines and boundaries originally were, and not where they ought to have been. Failing in this it is his business to re-establish them as nearly as possible in the place they were originally placed.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">As a general rule any deviation from the exact original survey is untenable and illegal.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">That last part \u201c<strong>any deviation from the exact original survey is</strong> <strong>untenable and illegal</strong>.\u201d Untenable means <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">indefensible</span>. You know what illegal means. So, are you telling me that I shouldn\u2019t re-size the section to make sure that iron pin I found at a fence corner, or that 36-in tree with wire 12-inches deep in it are in the right location? <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">You\u2019re damn right</span>. That\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s saying. If we have evidence, even a little evidence, a <em><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/scintilla\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">scintilla</span></a></em>, that the corners that we find were set \u201c<strong>by an authorized person</strong>\u201d then THAT IS THE CORNER.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Am I being too dramatic? I think not.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">The correctness or the accuracy of the original survey is seldom involved or is rarely of much concern to the person making the resurvey. Usually if the first survey was improperly executed the resurvey must still retrace the same lines and encompass the same areas as the original survey.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">And then he hits it again.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">In making resurveys the surveyor has no official power to decide disputed points, or to locate new points. He can act only as an expert witness</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">So, if you set a second pin, or a third or a fourth where an old pin has been for years, and it has been used by all of the adjoining landowners, your actions are UNTENABLE AND ILLEGAL.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span class=\"font-size-4\" style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u201c...UNTENABLE and ILLEGAL\u201d</span></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">I believe that Faircloth would have used bold and big letters if the typewriter could have done that.

I believe that most of us know enough about the many different measurement techniques and the equipment that can be used, that we can measure a line to a precision level of 1:50,000 or better. Heck we could probably get to 1:100,000 on a good day with the right equipment.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-3\" style=\"color: #000000;\">But if I\u2019m not finding the original corner or re-establishing it, then my work is just untenable.

The thing to remember is that Land Surveying practice varies from location to location and there are different customs on how Land Surveys are performed. This is not to even mention the differences in Case Law and Codified Law which are completely at odds with each other from one jurisdiction to the next. Your presentation of a PLS diagram is a perfect example as this does not even exist in many States, including where I am from in Texas. My feeling has always been that the idea is to locate the original boundary placed by the original land surveyor (even if it is nothing but a paper survey). The intent of the original survey is what the Land Surveyor must locate. Unwritten transfers of land through possession or other legal theory are not permitted to be determined by the Land Surveyor. This makes quite a bit of difference in how I look at evidence as compared to say a Land Surveyor in Utah looks at it.

We all have gotten calls and comments like this. So, don\u2019t get upset or offended when you do. Unfortunately our profession hasn\u2019t had or developed the professional reputation that we would desire. Folks still think of us as \u201ccontractors\u201d who they can get low bids from. And, others like realtors, attorneys, and fence contractors don\u2019t help us much. So, be patient and be ready to explain why our costs are the way they are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second reason is to give you a possible response when we DO get these comments to give your potential client some insights into how we price surveying. I make a few \u201carguments\u201d and \u201cjustifications\u201d as to why surveying is worth what we quote, and many times much more than we quote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is the exchange, which I will post in it\u2019s entirety, changing the names of course.</span></p>\n<h2>First Email Contact: <i>Xavier D.

You just do not send a crew ,to get out of a truck make one setup and say your corner goes right here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They could just build the fence and hope they do not have to move it later, but the fence company who would like that, and would say it not our mistake.</p>\n<p>You should have paid for a very good survey. So how much is this 1 or 2 points worth ??? . The price to know where they are and to be sure.</p>\n<p>This will cost you less in the long run. The surveyor has to stand behind his work the fence builder just has to build a fence. You are paying for more</p>\n<p>than just where do they go. You are paying for peace of mind. So how much does that cost.</p>","createdDate":"2017-06-10T22:40:16.074Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:382875","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"June 20th is a Tuesday - Record a Point For Community","description":"<p>Unlike most of the previous years, Survey Earth in a Day happens on a workday this year. \u00a0In previous years, surveyors needed to borrow RTK equipment for the weekend, but this year, we hope everyone will participate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.surveyearth.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.surveyearth.com/assets/public/images/surveying-intro.gif\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Survey Earth in a Day community\" class=\"align-full\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"font-size-5\"><strong>For Those Who Are New To Our Community</strong></span></p>\n<div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bm-col col-md-12\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bm-col col-md-12\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><h1 id=\"TIE_2\" class=\"mce-content-body\">What is Survey Earth in a Day?</h1>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bm-col col-md-12\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bm-col col-md-12\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bm-col col-md-12\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bm-col col-md-12\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div id=\"TE_1\" class=\"mce-content-body\"><p><span><span>6th Annual Worldwide Celebration of the Land Surveying Practice, Surveying Industry and Surveyor Culture!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Join us on\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Tuesday June 20th @ Noon</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0and\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Occupy a monument or marker and Submit a Point</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0from\u00a0</span><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\">YOUR LOCATION</em><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0in representation of Surveyors in your continent, country, state, city or zip code!\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">SURVEYORS ONLY!</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0No Cellphone GPS data accepted.

With so much on their plate, it\u2019s of the utmost importance that these project managers be able to take advantage of the new and innovative technologies that can drive value across the project.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One example of such a technology is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The hype surrounding UAVs is growing louder across a host of industry settings, but land surveying is one area where that hype is certainly justified. In this post, we\u2019ll take a closer look at several of the ways that UAVs can benefit land surveying projects.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>1.\u00a0</b><b>Increase speed of surveying</b></p>\n<p>One of the chief drawbacks of traditional surveying methods is the amount of time they can take to complete. This should be a serious area of concern for project managers, because the more time a project spends in the surveying stage, the longer it will take for the project to begin the more tangible phases.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>UAVs can address this issue by dramatically speeding up the initial project assessment and surveying components. By covering as much 6 square miles in a single day, and delivering data that can be turned around and ready for the project team to use in as little as 24 hours, UAVs can essentially remove land surveying as a source of roadblocks on a project.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>2.</b> <b>Increase worker safety</b></p>\n<p>There\u2019s no denying that land surveying isn\u2019t always the safest occupation that a worker might engage in. When land surveyors have to cross difficult terrain in order to gather the data they need, it doesn\u2019t just create a source of delays\u2014it also puts those workers at risk of serious injury.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For project managers, doing everything they can to ensure worker safety isn\u2019t just the right thing to do. It also makes sense from a business perspective, as accidents are both costly and time-consuming. With UAVs, surveyors can gather data about difficult terrain without actually having to cross that terrain. In fact, they can do everything their job requires without ever having to leave a designated safe work location.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>3.\u00a0</b><b>Increase accuracy</b></p>\n<p>Fast land surveying doesn\u2019t help much unless it\u2019s also accurate. Mistakes at the land surveying stage can lead to very costly and time-consuming issues later on in the project, so it\u2019s important that you get things right the first time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s UAVs can be attached with the latest in imaging technology. This includes high-resolution cameras that are capable of capturing images with 1 cm of accuracy. When combined with the unique capabilities of UAVs to observe terrain from all angles and proximities\u2014even in the case of difficult-to-reach terrain\u2014the result is detailed, accurate images that can be used to support high-quality project work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Final thoughts</b></p>\n<p>In truth, this post is only able to scratch the surface of the potential benefits of using UAVs for land surveying projects. This powerful new technology is only limited by the skill and creativity of the people using it, so it's important that project managers adopt it now in order to start maximizing its advantages.</p>","createdDate":"2017-04-06T16:32:46.201Z","updatedDate":"2018-11-21T14:27:12.051Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2017-04-06T16:32:46.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:372242","contributorName":"1v3uuei9mle4c","title":"WTH: Why The Hell Are You Surveying So Cheap?","description":"<p>I wrote this <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wth-why-hell-you-surveying-so-cheap-j-keith-maxwell\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>\u00a0on LinkedIn in October of last year.

Evidently he called me because he thought your price was too high. I didn\u2019t know that till I spent an hour measuring and figuring and estimating what it would take to do the job. I talked to my field surveyor and got him to look at it with me. It\u2019s 53 acres of recently cut-over woods, with a creek along one side (1600 LF), a dirt road on one side (2200 LF) and 3800 LF of woods lines. (See the picture above.) And, the site is two hours from my field guy\u2019s office.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not knowing that he had talked to anyone else prior to calling me (had I known I couldn\u2019t even have talked to him legally because of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wth-why-hell-illegal-bid-survey-work-j-keith-maxwell?trk=mp-author-card\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>QBS</strong></a>) I gave him my best price of $4,100 to $4,600. He let out a yelp. \u201c<em><strong>Wooo</strong>, I thought the other guy was high and\u00a0<strong>he quoted about half that</strong></em>.\u201d I laughed out loud. \u201c<em>You\u2019ve got to be kidding me</em>\u201d I said.</p>\n<div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><a href=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAhfAAAAJGYzM2RmZGU0LThkMGEtNDJkZC04MGQ2LTI2MzEyNWY1ZTY0MA.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAhfAAAAJGYzM2RmZGU0LThkMGEtNDJkZC04MGQ2LTI2MzEyNWY1ZTY0MA.png?width=480\" width=\"480\" class=\"align-center\"/></a></div>\n<p>So, Mr. Cheap, I\u2019d really like to know how you keep your costs so low that you\u2019re able to charge $0.30 per linear foot on average for the same survey. That was the low end of what I priced work at in 1989, when I started practicing land surveying.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><u>Some things that happened in 1989:</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple introduced a new portable computer. The retail price was $5,800.</li>\n<li>The first of 24 satellites of the Global Positioning System (GPS) were placed into orbit.</li>\n<li>The Energizer Bunny replaced Mary Lou Retton as company spokesperson.</li>\n<li>DNA genetic evidence was first allowed as admissible evidence in court.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p><u>Some cost related items in 1989 compared to today:</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was $2,753 then, today it closed above $18,300.</li>\n<li>The average income per year was $27,450.00, in 2015 it was $44,600.</li>\n<li>The average monthly rent was $420, this year it\u2019s $1,300</li>\n<li>The average price for a new car, $15,350, today it\u2019s $33,560.</li>\n<li>1 gallon of gas was $0.97, today it\u2019s $2.22.</li>\n<li>The minimum wage was $3.35, today it\u2019s $7.25.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Are you recognizing a pattern here yet?</strong>\u00a0Lot\u2019s of things are\u00a0<strong>at least doubling since 1989</strong>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is this thing called the Inflation Rate that I want to introduce to you. The Inflation Rate is a way to boil down all of the costs of different things over the years in today's\u2019 dollars. Or, how far does my dollar go today compared to a certain year in the past. Using the\u00a0<a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=0.3&amp;year1=1989&amp;year2=2016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Inflation Calculator</a>, since 1989, the US Inflation Rate has caused what cost $0.30 in 1989 to cost $0.58 in 2016 dollars, a 98% increase. That\u2019s about double, matching our pattern above.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>So, why are you charging 1989 prices for land surveying in 2016?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-right\"><a href=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAktAAAAJDhkZDlmOWRjLTlmNGUtNDdiOC1hNDVhLTIzZTFlNzU3OWE1Ng.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAktAAAAJDhkZDlmOWRjLTlmNGUtNDdiOC1hNDVhLTIzZTFlNzU3OWE1Ng.png?width=300\" width=\"300\" class=\"align-right\"/></a></div>\n<p>Now you may have been charging $0.15/linear foot in 1989 (which would have been 1977 pricing then.) You may also think that I was charging too much in 1989. Well, before I worked on my own, I worked with other surveyors and had a pretty good idea what prices were then. I also knew how much I had to pay my crew, how much their health insurance cost, how much I contributed to their 401 K plans, what gas cost, my rent, and what the truck payment was.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t charge whatever you want for your work. Heck I\u2019ve even done work for free in the past, voluntarily. We all have occasion to help someone who needs it every now and then. It\u2019s called charity. This was not the case today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, I\u2019ve made the assumption that you\u2019re doing quality work. Maybe that\u2019s assuming too much. I know of a few folks who work for pennies that are worth pennies. I don\u2019t really know you at all so I can\u2019t comment. Quality isn\u2019t something we as professionals can negotiate. The landowners we deal with should expect that a licensed surveyor will be able to turn out a survey that would close on itself, and represent the actual conditions of the property boundaries. If your surveys don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re cheating your clients.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The best example I have of quality is the difference between the 1-Ply Toilet Paper you find in lots of public bathrooms like Walmart or McDonalds and what you probably buy for your house. I don\u2019t skimp on toilet paper. Quality determines whether you have crap on your hand after use or not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bottom line, you are selling yourself short, very short. And, leaving that much money on the table is kind of ignorant. Think about what it\u2019s worth for someone to have a survey of their land. Think a little more highly of your profession, of yourself and your employees.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>J.

With so much on their plate, it\u2019s of the utmost importance that these project managers be able to take advantage of the new and innovative technologies that can drive value across the project.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>One example of such a technology is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The hype surrounding UAVs is growing louder across a host of industry settings, but land surveying is one area where that hype is certainly justified. In this post, we\u2019ll take a closer look at several of the ways that UAVs can benefit land surveying projects.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increase speed of surveying</strong><br/>One of the chief drawbacks of traditional surveying methods is the amount of time they can take to complete. This should be a serious area of concern for project managers, because the more time a project spends in the surveying stage, the longer it will take for the project to become profitable.<br/><p><br/>UAVs can address this issue by dramatically speeding up surveying. By covering as much 6 square miles in a single day, and delivering data that can be turned around and ready for the project team to use in as little as 24 hours, UAVs can essentially remove land surveying as a source of roadblocks to a profitable project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Increase worker safety</strong><br/>There\u2019s no denying that land surveying isn\u2019t always the safest occupation that a worker might engage in. When land surveyors have to cross difficult terrain in order to gather the data they need, it doesn\u2019t just create a source of delays\u2014it also puts those workers at risk of serious injury.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>For project managers, doing everything they can to ensure worker safety isn\u2019t just the right thing to do. It also makes sense from a business perspective, as accidents are both costly and time-consuming. With UAVs, surveyors can gather data about difficult terrain without actually having to cross that terrain. In fact, they can do everything their job requires without ever having to leave a designated safe work location.<br/><br/></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Increase accuracy</strong><br/>Fast land surveying doesn\u2019t help much unless it\u2019s also accurate. Mistakes at the land surveying stage can lead to very costly and time-consuming issues later on in the project, so it\u2019s important that you get things right the first time.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Today\u2019s UAVs can be attached with the latest in imaging technology. This includes high-resolution cameras that are capable of capturing images with 1 cm of accuracy. When combined with the unique capabilities of UAVs to observe terrain from all angles and proximities\u2014even in the case of difficult-to-reach terrain\u2014the result is detailed, accurate images that can be used to support high-quality project work.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong><br/>In truth, this post is only able to scratch the surface of the potential benefits of using UAVs for land surveying projects. This powerful new technology is only limited by the skill and creativity of the people using it, so it's important that project managers adopt it now in order to start maximizing its advantages.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","createdDate":"2017-03-23T18:19:26.178Z","updatedDate":"2017-03-23T18:19:26.178Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"draft","publishTime":"2017-03-23T18:19:26.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:371072","contributorName":"2h399hj381jbx","title":"Hello From Portugal, land surveyor, civil engineer, and some software part-time","description":"<p>Hello.</p>\n<p>I\u00b4m from Portugal.</p>\n<p>Now my main activity is in road and rail design.</p>\n<p>I work with Autocad, ISPOL, and soon begin with Bentley PRT.</p>\n<p>I\u00b4m also a surveyor (not much now)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In part-time i do some programming.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You could visit one of may App for land surveying calculations...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also maintain a blog about this issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jcoimbras.blogspot.com.es/\" target=\"_blank\">http://jcoimbras.blogspot.com.es/</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rfo.Topografia\" target=\"_blank\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rfo.Topografia</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/F4EzHzhvXEVUdYQfna0*GsqYOzKn-hB24Lgn1SnggQYCMI7bmhAdH4HKzKZRFQz7uZxxW0-XMnYdQVz2uK7d4Tw*D09A4p5v/Screenshot_20170315171714.png\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/F4EzHzhvXEVUdYQfna0*GsqYOzKn-hB24Lgn1SnggQYCMI7bmhAdH4HKzKZRFQz7uZxxW0-XMnYdQVz2uK7d4Tw*D09A4p5v/Screenshot_20170315171714.png?width=500\" width=\"500\" class=\"align-center\"/></a></p>","createdDate":"2017-03-15T17:26:58.883Z","updatedDate":"2019-01-09T16:44:07.523Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2017-03-15T17:26:58.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:370875","contributorName":"1p1rr5d9egw2r","description":"Hi everyone,\n\nI use GeoMax-GPSGNSS-ZGP800-Series and I face with the problem that I cannot adjest my survey style and also I cannot measure the RTK and PPK points.

One important tip \u2013 passing the national exam may still not qualify you in some states. Be certain that you check out any state requirements too. If this is your first career position, you know that you will be at entry-level and will need to apprentice (fortunately it\u2019s paid) for about four years in most states. At that point, you are ready to apply for positions as a professional land surveyor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Entry or Professional Level \u2013 These Search Tips May Help</b></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surveyors can work for either government offices or for private firms (e.g., engineering, architectural). This actually adds up to be a lot of opportunities if you are looking in the right places. As you start your search, here are nine tips that should help you out.</p>\n<p>\u00a01. <b>\u00a0</b> <b>Use a Variety of Job Boards</b></p>\n<p>Employers that need land surveyors often use a variety of online job boars to advertise their positions. If you are only using one or two boards, you may be missing out on some job opportunities. Post your resume at Indeed, Monster, Snagajob, and other major websites.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, don\u2019t forget locally created job boards. You could find work through websites that are specifically targeted to the construction, architectural, and engineering industries, for example.</p>\n<p><b>2. Be Sure that You are Checking Federal, State, and Local Government Job Board</b></p>\n<p>Most government jobs fall into the category of \u201ccivil Service.\u201d There may be additional examinations to take, especially at the federal level, but this should not stop you. There is a point system established for most jobs, but another background can move you up in the system. For example, you will have extra points added if you are a veteran. For specialized categories that require education and certification, you will need to present your licenses as well.</p>\n<p><b>\u00a03.\u00a0</b> <b>Be Certain that Your Resume is Polished</b></p>\n<p>Resumes can be tough to craft, especially if you at the entry level. However, using a professional service, such as <a href=\"http://www.resumescentre.com\" target=\"_self\">www.resumescentre.com</a> can go a long way to present yourself in the best manner. Most people are not skilled in resume creation, so get professional help.</p>\n<p><b>4.</b> <b>Establish a LinkedIn Profile and Become Active</b></p>\n<p>Land surveying is a profession, and establishing <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/05/19/ten-ways-to-use-linkedin-in-your-job-search/#4e521ff6a3d2\">a profile can be really beneficial</a>. Once you have established your profile, you can then seek out groups to join that let you network with peers and potential employers. Peers can point in the direction of openings they know about; if you can establish connections with potential employers, you may be personally alerted by them when an opening arises. You can also post your resume and receive alerts about job postings. LinkedIn is continually expanding its operations. Keep abreast and take advantage of every opportunity to engage with others and keep your name out there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<b>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b> <b>Join the</b> <a href=\"http://www.nsps.us.com/\">National Society of Professional Surveyors</a> <b>(NSPS)</b></p>\n<p>As soon as you have your license, join. There are also regional and local chapters, and you can become active in those. The value is that there is a lot of networking that goes on, and you can get great leads and recommendations if you have made solid connections with other members. The national website also has a link to employment opportunities \u2013 just one more resource for you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<b>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b> <b>Stay in Touch with Your College Career Office</b></p>\n<p>You just never know. Sometimes, firms looking for surveyors contact colleges and universities that they know have land surveyor programs. Be sure that you regularly check in, let the office know that you are still looking or looking for a change.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<b>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b> <b>Take a Job in a Related Field While You Look</b></p>\n<p>Potential employers like to see that you are serious about your career. If you take a job in retail while you are waiting for an opening, you don\u2019t look as good on your resume or during an interview. Working for a real estate broker or firm or a title company (all three use land surveyors at times), in any capacity, can demonstrate your continued interest in your field. You can take a position in <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-title-searcher-do.htm\">title searching</a>, for example \u2013 while it is not high paying, it will give you related experience.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<b>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b> <b>Beware of Paid Job Search Websites</b></p>\n<p>Just don\u2019t do it. They have nothing to offer that you cannot find anywhere else.</p>\n<p><b>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b> <b>Do Sign Up with Non-Fee Based Recruitment Firms</b></p>\n<p>Once you have that great resume crafted, be certain to send it to every recruitment firm that does not charge its job seekers fees. While land surveyor positions are not necessarily plentiful, having your resume on file with them is just one more place where you are visible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Be Aggressive but Patient</b></p>\n<p><b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>A job search is a daily activity, and those who take initiative every day will be rewarded.

It gives clear understanding</p>\n<p>of the situation. Without picture being formed in the mind of a person, It will be like a dark</p>\n<p>circle. So now days people are emphasizing more on the things which give them proper</p>\n<p>understanding of actual thing. Like in case of drawings the 3D formats of drawing are more</p>\n<p>preferred than the drafting which were previously used. It gives complete information in one</p>\n<p>view. Software companies ares also coming forward to help man to meet with the demand.</p>\n<p>Drafting is the 2D representation of a thing. It can be done both on software and paper. But</p>\n<p>with the increase in demand of using the 3D software in all types of industries, drafting has</p>\n<p>loss its value. But still it has its own importance in certain fields. In case of land survey, the</p>\n<p>drafting has lost its importance. All the work in more preferred on 3D civil. Everyone wants</p>\n<p>that work should be done in minimum time and this is only possible by the use of 3D civil. In</p>\n<p>it more than one features can be seen in one view.</p>\n<p>Not only the presence of features are important but how they exactly look like give more idea</p>\n<p>about a place. It can be taken in the same way like a clear photo give more knowledge about a</p>\n<p>thing than its sketch. Softwares are there by which the 3D view can be depicted very easily</p>\n<p>these days and all this is due to demand of it in market. In land survey drafting the people</p>\n<p>use to take measure by their own of all the places and reference them from a point. This</p>\n<p>procedure is likely involves mistakes due to human error or fatigue. No one can be perfect</p>\n<p>and it is stated fact until and unless the work is done by computerised program.</p>\n<p>So a computerized program which involes depiction of whole picture of an area is the perfect</p>\n<p>solution of a problem. The various formats are thus made available so that there would be no</p>\n<p>problem in getting desiered result. It is not only true for land survery but for all type of work.</p>\n<p>Land survery help in getting many types of information. These informations are basis of</p>\n<p>some important decisions so in all way the information should be perfect. All these reasons</p>\n<p>thus make civil 3D more important then drafting.</p>\n<p><br/> <a href=\"http://www.westernlogan.com\" target=\"_self\">Land Surveying CAD Drafting</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.westernlogan.com\" target=\"_self\">CAD Drafting Services</a></p>","createdDate":"2017-02-06T06:39:49.163Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-05T08:10:52.545Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2017-02-06T06:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:364071","contributorName":"2h6k5xxpcavlb","description":"<p>WesternLogan is world largest\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.westernlogan.com\" target=\"_blank\">CAD Drafting company</a>.

It is the largest body of professional land surveyors in the world and if you have even the slightest clue what a surveyor is, you can imagine how this sort of thing could have a dynamic impact upon all construction worldwide.

I am an electrical engineer and so I can share with you some experience with usb devices and cables.\n\nIf the cable you purchased is just a usb cable (no electronics imbedded in the cable ends or middle), then you need to know that usb is not just usb. USB has gone through many iterations. If we were talking about chips, most chips are backwards compatible, so that is not an issue.. But if we are talking about a \"straight\" (no internal electronics) cable, the cable might ONLY pass a USB 1.0 signal when you might need a USB cable that can pass USB 2.0 signals (much higher frequency). Check the specs on your Carlson and on your Topcon gts 301 to see what USB version you need.\n\nIf the cable has internal electronics...as most of your car computer connection (CAN) cables, you probably are encountering a very different story. The cheap CAN cables have a Chinese chip USB controller. it is a fake which does not work consistently. It has all the part numbers of the USA chip (which is patented) and so it is difficult to know you have a counterfit. the more expensive cables all have manufacturers who point this issue out and guarantee they use the correect part.\n\nI would need to know more to help you. feel free to contact me here or at my email: whburling@outlook.com","createdDate":"2016-11-28T22:44:55.230Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:353498","contributorName":"23y8klfgvl85e","title":"GNSS/GPS RTK Systems with Dual Frequency and Heading","description":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://www.tersus-gnss.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Precis-BX316</a>\u00a0GNSS Board, the\u00a0RTK System with L1L2/G1G2/B1B2 &amp; Heading at Affordable Prices.

However, the veteran land surveyors are just now- for the first time in history- sharing and documenting their expertise from the field. Students and new surveyors simply have never been exposed to the methods and approaches to land surveying rooted in history. If you think you have nothing to contribute, consider sharing experiences on several ways to approach the same surveying job. Every moment you spend communicating with other surveyors pumps 10 years into the profession. Photos, video and stories shared from the field will outlive you online.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Aside from a few years as a surveyor myself, I have always been a fly on the wall in respect to surveyor discussions, whether in my dad's shop, online or otherwise.\u00a0 The follow are really just some ideas that I think about quite a bit, in general terms.\u00a0 Perhaps a few of you will recognize what i am trying to do here. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Historically, surveyor communication was a geographical challenge, presenting legal hurdles, traversed by technological adaptability and controlled by print media. Most of those problems still exist. The fence which silently causes the most lack of agreement is the one many can\u2019t help straddling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a target=\"_self\"><img class=\"align-right\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/U7JnYe6VCEh7mPNNZfXXofIjzQF6KUz0xUGe40pqI0QpEC2Nk4Xq5oKip8kx8MTPaNfx98aKIyvef369xh93X4tj79ricUmu/4013Image008.jpg?width=250\" alt=\"button pushers\" width=\"250\"/></a>Many of the problems plaguing the surveying industry are related to generational gaps which have been created by differential technological adaptations with a lot of push back as well as resistance. As one surveyor from Wisconsin has expressed to me on many occasion, \u201cWe will never advance as a profession with the same old <em>\u201cAll in Favor say I\u201d</em> mentality.\u201d The young surveyors do not understand such processes. So as they eagerly try to adapt themselves to rigid systems without any social engagement, they find themselves in an awkward position, having to ask for advice from a person with more experience,without really knowing what it is they should ask for.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is why we must act.\u00a0 We must continue to build our sub groups and local hubs in order to do more than just maintain categorical /topical organization of our <strong>living library of surveying</strong>, we must create campaigns to create local public awareness of the importance of measurement professionals to society and civilization. For <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/group/studentsurveyors\" target=\"_self\">student surveyors</a>, this will never occur if two important things do not happen simultaneously.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) The student must be brave enough to ask his/her mentor other \u2018analog\u2019 approaches to a solution.</p>\n<p>2) The experienced surveyor must be willing to explain and demonstrate other methods and do away with the idea of the \"button pusher\" because it doesn't help anyone involved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Students, don\u2019t be afraid to grab a pencil and field book every once in a while and see if you could have done your job without your fancy equipment. The wiser and more experienced surveyor most likely didn\u2019t need that equipment in the first place and could show you 3 ways to complete the work with a chain, plumbob and transit. This is why they call them Chief. You are a new member of their tribe and you can only Party when the Chief trusts the product.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"align-right\" src=\"https://scontent-mia1-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14355721_10155246734717586_7202489828922188643_n.jpg?oh=98fda33203f18f695284291b1837cc02&amp;oe=58846A34&amp;width=250\" width=\"250\"/></a>The Chief has his own party to go to. The older and wiser surveyor who has been in the field with a calculator, field book and transit for 30 year, like his father and his father\u2019s father similarly facing challenges of job security and has been adapting to new technologies for thousands of years. This Surveyor has the experience and expertise that will disappear in the pages of time, if not purposefully shared for the surveyors of the future to learn from. This knowledge has not been publicly recorded until recently.This means we simply have hundreds if not thousands of years of surveying knowledge to document together.\u00a0 This is our opportunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The public understands why real estate agents would work together, but surveyors unite under and around different issues which arise during normal operation, with equipment, software, competence, inner crew dynamics,environmental change,animal conflict, human conflict, vandalism, market changes and the list goes on. The wise one resents the <em>button pusher</em> because they wish they could have all the time back that they could have saved with the newest advancement, but at the same time, they wish they could inject their years of experience, like a USB, into their newest crew member who controls all of the gadgets on site. Chief eventually becomes ambitious immediately followed by frustration after realizing the young guy will always know more about how to operate the digital version of an analog process. Problems spring up when the wise try to muscle the solution from the data collector. It doesn\u2019t do what it should have. Asking the new guy for help lowers credibility and may show signs of weakness. With ease, the fresh college grad simplifies the daily tasks for the wise one. Socratic dialogue rarely happens as it does in other industries where fresh new ideas are introduced on a regular basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>Surveying Veterans and Student Surveyors Need One Another More than Ever Before..</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><br/> Land Surveyors United is your community and your venue for engagement.

Christopher Columbus didn't have satellite navigation but he used the same basic techniques to navigate across the Atlantic.\nSome must think that any surveyor past middle age is still pulling a chain &amp; using a compass. Surely, all surveyors should stay abreast of technology.\nThe first time I heard the term \"button pusher\" was in an article in POB, authored by a very well educated Land Surveyor whom is also a lawyer. There is nothing wrong with \"button pushing\" as long as you understand what the button is doing. No surveying program can take the place of sound surveying practice &amp; a comprehensive knowledge of the legal principles of boundary location &amp; retracement. Today, a competent surveyor must also have a working knowledge of State Plain coordinates, geodetic surveying &amp; survey grade GPS positioning. Today's surveyor is better educated than ever before, especially those with a BS degree in a good surveying curriculum. Unfortunately, an alarming number of surveyors are happily pushing buttons and accepting the results as absolute without the foggiest notion of what they are doing. Some don't know the difference between a transit plane survey &amp; a geodetic survey. I had a young man that graduated from a surveying tech curriculum tell me that there was no difference between ground &amp; grid coordinates. Don't laugh, his boss, a registered PE &amp; land surveyor of over 35 years, almost as long as I have have been a PLS, didn't know either.\nAS a side note, Mr. Carlson came to the office where I was briefly employed a couple years ago &amp; demonstrated his software. I was working with his full Civil Suite at the time. Except for that unpleasant interlude, I have been self employed since 1983. Pretty powerful stuff if you have an application for that sort of thing &amp; can make it pay for itself. I don't &amp; wasn't impressed. That engineering department had all sorts of expensive equipment paid for by the taxpayers that nobody could operate.","createdDate":"2016-09-18T01:53:41.383Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:346083","contributorName":"2552gik9q33uz","description":"Hi my dear JUSTIN and friends.\nI am so proud to be associate with you being a Sri Lankan,Oldest Department started in 1800,\nAs a young guy aged 21 years,joined as a apprentice surveyor,\nOn the first day we had an exhibition of the history of surveying and film,\nShowing a base lone measurment,\nA 1second thiodolite used for triangulation.\nI was a proud surveyor to see all these,and I had along breath ,and so anxious to step on to my future.\nWe started with seven figur log tables,Fasit calculating machine,slide rules,sun azimuth observations and gone through basics.\nAll young surveyors should creap through the ladder.\nSo they will get that plesure every time they push a button!","createdDate":"2016-09-15T13:22:26.101Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:346079","contributorName":"1a771lgn0x3yq","description":"<p>Hi Everyone,This has always been,every generation of Surveyors,has faced this,because there is always something new.When you get Tidal Locked,nothing changes,when you start to rotate different ,you see new things. I have watched surveying evolve. You must evolve,with it,or you will be stuck in the past,and will not learn nothing new. One time crossing a River,there was no EDM's,so Triangle time.After it was all said and done, i told my mentor, I have a new programmable calculator, i like to solve these triangles. He gives me that look,but then he let me do it, of course i had to set down and program it, He watched as i done this, but there was only 30 lines to this program, a few minutes, i was done,He did not own a scientific calculator,he thank me,and the day was over,but i felt i had hurt his feeling, this man, was like a father to me, as far as respect goes,I look up to him in every way, we had worked along time together, and he had taught me everything i knew as far as land surveying the US public land system, I had even worked for him when i was in high school,but that day everything changed,That night he had recalculated all the triangles at home ,with out a calculator. The next morning, I was nervous,wishing i had not even asked,when we met he was all smiles, Bill, all your answer were good,how much does this calculator cost. Can you teach me,how this works and what else will it do. This event,started this man ,who had surveyed since 1949,to evolve into the Future, and before it was all done in his life, he had learn how to use a HP 41CX and a HP 48GX TDS survey pro Data Collector ,after that i do not know. This is the magic that can take place. Modern Calculators to me are not old school to me. The HP 48GX TDS, even today works as good or almost as good as any Data collector, just not GPS. Some of the new calculators today or using computer language, and touch screen,Everyone has to use one, to get there License, you sure can not take a lap top to the test and only certain calculators you can use, so somebody has to teach them how you can do this on a calculator,But surveying is also a tradition,almost a word of mouth,being pass on to the next line,young surveyors ,need to see how it was done and learn how this can be done,why because you need plan A ,B.C, because there will be times in a young surveyor life,maybe the way something he is doing, something ( A ) will not work,the way he is doing it. Is there another way, also ( B ) problems with equipment,then back up plan, or do i have a calculator or i need to calculate something. ( C ) , when all else fails a note book and a pencil,. And please tell me again, how do you become a surveyor when all 50 states in the US, you must take your test with a calculator. As far as i know!!. I always could not wait to get my hands on something new, and there has always been something,some one has showed me Young or Old, so do not get hung up on, no matter what you know,young Dogs and Old dogs can learn new Tricks.And i have been lucky to experience this my whole Survey career.Help can go Both Ways.surveyors have always took Pride on how they were able to perform certain things from rolling up a chain to tying a plumb bob knot,to setting up a instrument,and how good you were on a level run, this pride should be taken on all the new methods,of surveying as well as the old.So the next time you hear me speak of something in the past,I am always stepping into the future no matter who or what, Young or old,\u00a0 and where i can find it from , It doesn't matter.</p>","createdDate":"2016-09-15T08:43:24.423Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:345989","contributorName":"3ci4753gge739","description":"<p>As my mind and body go away I continue to hope that the people in my past reaped some benefit from what I shared with them.\u00a0 I am one of those old fashioned surveyors who decided to integrate new technology with old methods of problem solving.\u00a0 My mind and body are broken.\u00a0 I am glad for those who will follow my footsteps.\u00a0 They may find my mistakes and they\u00a0may admire the things I did right.\u00a0 But whatever they find it is certain the future belongs to them.\u00a0 May God bless them.</p>","createdDate":"2016-09-15T03:08:55.457Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:346074","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"<p>Good to see you Mike and William!\u00a0 Thank you for sharing your experiences with us.\u00a0 This community would not be what it is if it were not for your future oriented contributions to our living library.\u00a0</p>","createdDate":"2016-09-15T02:01:51.009Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:345807","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"<p>I fear the same Pat.\u00a0 Welcome to the community, by the way!\u00a0 I love that you mention <em>relevance</em> because it seems to be the hardest thing to achieve in the surveying profession on all sides.\u00a0 Perhaps that is what is truly missing- if everyone understood and acknowledged one another as truly relevant regardless of age or tech proficiency the conversation would become more honest, more engageable and more progressive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am but a fly on the wall of surveying history.\u00a0 Truthfully, so are all of you but with a more intimate view.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you guys for chiming in..</p>","createdDate":"2016-09-15T01:58:30.048Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:345917","contributorName":"2q0rjwdnfdvos","description":"<p>Yes, I don't embrace the full extent, two reasons, sometimes old school work better for us, we know the process, we know how to error trap and we don't waste time trying to figure out new stuff. and second, the technology is change so fast, why waste time on obsolete stuff. \u00a0For example soon apps will be available which combine everything needed to survey, with dual frequency GPS chips and network corrections, allowing photo shots to create 3d models to scale, put that one your drone and smoke the job! \u00a0I dont know civil3d but I use Carlson with autocad and Boston Harbor add on ribbon to my 2006 autocad (anybody know how to make it work on intellecad?) \u00a0I now carry my spin plot, record surveys and CAD file on a 8\" tablet (Sony or Samsung) their batteries last 14 hrs plus of use, the screens are visible in daylight.

I was blessed to have been trained by a group of surveyors that didn't let their egos dictate how they taught or ran their crew. Technology was just starting to come of age back in 1999 when I started. Fortunately I began with the basics at the time. An HP48...It wasn't a data collector and all my angles had to be written down by hand and we used the gun \"Naked\" as I like to say! I learned trig, how to solve curves, and base 10 arithmetic. That was all fine and dandy to start out. As time progressed GPS became more user friendly and more readily available. The jobs got bigger and the pace of construction accelerated. Then in 2006-2008 the economy fell apart. For me technology was at a standstill. The only companies I could find work with couldn't afford to upgrade their equipment and stay competitive. It wasn't until years later after moving to South Carolina that I was inundated with all the latest and greatest tools of the trade! Total stations, GPS with RTK, new data collectors with Bluetooth, WiFi, and completely new software, laptops, and smartphones! I was up for the challenge but I knew I had to let go of some of the \"Old\" ways and evolve into one of the those \"Button Pushers\" on get passed by! Needless to say it has given me a whole new zeal for my job! As time goes on the \"Old Timers\" are retiring and passing the torch down to surveyors like me. I think it's important to share my past experiences as well as to keep an open mind to new techniques! I was told early on that a surveyor is only as good as his bag of tricks.

Sometimes for opinions on professional relationships. \u00a0I was taught most of what I know by two other surveyors, Rod Vargus and Ceaser Chacon, who took me under their wing, because they saw my love for the profession, and like I wanted to pass on what surveyors have passed on for 3000 years to the next generation. \u00a0For our craft to survive another 3000 years (should the Lord not come sooner, and it looks a lot sooner from what I see) then we must also be willing to do so, even at the cost of losing some work in the short run to younger, stronger, physically faster surveyors (experience does save one a lot of time avoiding and fixing screwups). Just as we must not fear the \"Young Lords\" of our profession, we must embrace and not fear competition. \u00a0Without competition we stagnate and we price ourselves out of the market. \u00a0Many in California believe in all sorts of regulations for land surveyors, I have met many, and usually their hands have little or no calluses, they are what we field dogs can house dogs or lap dogs, they usually fear competition because if you put them in the field, where 80% of a successful survey takes place, they have trouble cutting the cheese. No to degrade office surveyors, but to encourage them to get out more often, then they will have more respect for what the field guys have to go thru, and perhaps help their pricing and discussions with the clients. \u00a0But back to the subject, I firmly believe that this group of surveyors who cannot or will not compete on a level playing field fear giving consumers a real choice of what they really want. When I get a call to stake a fence or a garage setback, I used to be able to stake just that, but now because the opinions of these surveyors, any line staked must be witnessed by the 2 endpoints meaning setting the corners and filing records. Now while I love the idea of corner records, 15 years ago they were a simple plat with the minimum information that any incompetent surveyor could retrace, in California these have become exercises in \u00a0clairvoyance (which last I checked wasnt on the exam) in what exactly the plan checker wants, who almost always isnt even an LS, so some layperson or apprentice who doesnt know how to get radial in a cul-de-sac is bleeding all over the CR. \u00a0When I tell them file as is, they just bleed some some and return it. \u00a0This process now reflects on the price of staking a garage from $700 here in CA to now $1600 minimum. \u00a0So who wants to pay as much for a survey as they pay for the fence, clients tell me, I just build the fence and if its wrong move it. So where does it go from there, of course to the already plugged up courts, everybody loses, including those who advocated this change to the rules, why, because I have to eat, so I bid the jobs they used to get, maybe I dont win them all, but now, they are hurting because of their own short sightedness. \u00a0 \u00a0</p>","createdDate":"2016-09-14T21:51:00.750Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:345645","contributorName":"01jxwis45bq0i","description":"I happen to be the odd combination of both, and in my humble opinion it seems like anytime you have a super technical growth period (like we have for the last 25 years) some people will embrace it and others will not.

They hurt themselves in the long run &amp; don't realize how they hurt Surveying since it is really a science &amp; an art. I believe the cream always rises to the top. But in the past it's been common that Party Chiefs were big jerks and more interested in submission than training. Hopefully those days are over.

I have almost 20 years of experience in the field of surveying. With over 12,000 jobs completed and experience from Topography Surveys, Construction surveys, Alta surveys, Residential surveys... all the way to Flood and Shoreline Certificates performed on the Hawaiian Islands. I have conquered just about everything in my professional surveying career. I have traveled from Canada all the way to South America to perform vast scopes of surveying work. With that said... I have fulfilled my passion and it was about time for me to move on in my career. About 5 years ago I got into LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). LiDAR involves flight, and because I love flying so much I strived to get my fixed pilot wing license and accomplished just that within the first years of starting my LiDAR business. I am proud to say I have completed numerous LiDAR jobs all around the nation including Hawaii. I now reside in Hawaii and run my LiDAR business from the islands. Due to the drastic weather changes on the islands we have migrated from a fixed wing aircraft to a Helicopter. Our company now performs LiDAR via Helicopter with a Helipod attached, which carries the LiDAR equipment. Long story short, I can't get enough of LiDAR! There is talk around LiDAR and how it will be highly centered around drone technology in the near future ... this is the reason I am fortune enough to stumble upon these forums. I want to learn ALL about LiDAR and how it will be integrated with drone technology. Our company is currently working on \u00a0a new website (<a href=\"http://www.lidarhawaii.com\">http://www.lidarhawaii.com</a>). Feel free to check it out and give feedback.I am looking forward to sharing knowledge and learning from this online community.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-Tom</p>\n<p><span><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">Boundary Surveys</font></span></p>\n<p><span><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">K-1 &amp; K-2 Surveys</font></span></p>\n<p><span><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">Shoreline Certification Surveys</font></span></p>\n<p><span><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">Topographic Surveys &amp; Mapping</font></span></p>\n<p><span><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">FEMA Elevation Certificates</font></span></p>\n<p><span><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">Construction Layout</font></span></p>\n<p><span><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">ALTA/ASCM\u00a0<span>Title Surveys</span></font></span></p>\n<p><span><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">Consolidation/Subdivision</font></span></p>\n<p><span><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">Control Networks</font></span></p>","createdDate":"2016-05-29T08:14:35.759Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-22T21:14:19.629Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2016-05-29T08:14:35.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:337793","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","description":"<p>Welcome to the community Tom! \u00a0We look forward to all you have to share with us and hope to learn from you!</p>","createdDate":"2016-06-30T02:47:37.252Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:334330","contributorName":"3a7kjcwfey1kj","title":"Using old measurents or go and measure it again?","description":"<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'arial' , 'helvetica' , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'arial' , 'helvetica' , sans-serif;\">Following examples are calculated with</span> <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bestnetwork.com.blogspot.geomtours\" target=\"_blank\">BestNetwork</a>.</span></span><br/><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'arial' , 'helvetica' , sans-serif;\">\u00a0</span></span> <br/><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br/></span></p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br/><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zG2zdA-5irY/VvGxWgyZklI/AAAAAAAACsg/fY6N8Xd8Fr4kL9ZyibdACC0QwT2_G9B0w/s1600/201603220914.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"286\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zG2zdA-5irY/VvGxWgyZklI/AAAAAAAACsg/fY6N8Xd8Fr4kL9ZyibdACC0QwT2_G9B0w/s400/201603220914.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></span></div>\n<p><br/><span style=\"font-family: 'arial' , 'helvetica' , sans-serif; font-size: small;\"><b>T<span style=\"font-family: 'arial' , 'helvetica' , sans-serif;\">ask</span></b></span> <br/><span style=\"font-family: 'arial' , 'helvetica' , sans-serif; font-size: small;\">Calculate new coordinates for <span style=\"font-family: 'arial' , 'helvetica' , sans-serif;\">a boundary in a forest.

The cost to run the community month to month is approx $300 but if I pay for the entire year up front, it would be a great savings at $1400 annually. \u00a0<span><strong>Option A)</strong></span>\u00a0Everyone who values this network should contribute at least $3-$10 to help me pay for the year of hosting and maintenance in advance so that I do not need to solicit donations. \u00a0I do not think it is ethical to both ask for donations (or beer money) while also running ads all over the website. \u00a0Likewise, I do not believe it to be ethical to monetize the fact that surveyors have support issues. \u00a0However, I am going into my final year of my phd and I cannot afford to pay for this network out of my pocket anymore. \u00a0If I cannot raise the money through donations I will have to go with the second choice.\u00a0<span><strong>Option B)</strong></span>\u00a0\u00a0I will have no choice but to begin charging for membership which may drastically alter the culture on this site. \u00a0If we all work together on this many great things can happen such as continuing education programs, online project management tools and more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\u00a0<strong><span>ENERGY</span></strong>\u00a0Going forward, I need to relinquish responsibility of several aspects of day to day moderation over to you, the surveyors and members of this community. \u00a0This means that all location based group hubs on the new platform need a Local Ambassador. \u00a0Hubs related to equipment and software will need to be lead by someone who works for the manufacturer as I have essentially socialized these brands way before any of them had social media accounts. \u00a0I have built brand loyalty for all of the companies by keeping all negative comments and brand bashing out of the forums and have sent hundreds of thousands of outbound links to these companies and have asked nothing in return.</p>","createdDate":"2016-05-24T14:34:43.732Z","updatedDate":"2016-05-24T14:34:43.732Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"draft","publishTime":"2016-05-24T14:34:43.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:334265","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"The Future is Bright for Land Surveyors","description":"<p><em><strong><span class=\"font-size-5\"><a href=\"http://surveyearth.com\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/uQzc4C36qjfqau70q-fJ3U5f6lkuLi*fwYohRzJTDiGZYo1OSqDGwS2B3tTl5jYPrSwSuTLHZfy2xiClF-vSt8mt*EvTHeTh/SEIAD5.gif\" alt=\"Survey Earth in a Day 5\" class=\"align-full\" width=\"100%\"/></a>Land Surveyors Have a Bright Future</span></strong></em></p>\n<p>This is something that I keep telling myself. \u00a0This is what my Dad (<a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profile/palmettoequipment\" target=\"_self\">Skip Farrow</a>) used to say whenever we hit a milestone with this community- and over the years, we hit <em>a lot</em>. \u00a0I've been putting off writing this post for almost a year. \u00a0It has simply been too difficult to write since my dad passed away last June. \u00a0Nevertheless, this is hopefully going to be a happy post in celebration of the life of a man who loved surveying, enjoyed helping surveyors accomplish their needs in the field and loved life. \u00a0However, some of the details maybe hard to swallow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scontent.ftpa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11223659_10152839223491673_4157924758096106429_n.jpg?oh=e1a499a66baf2fbbbf91494f31d869bc&amp;oe=579D6235\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://scontent.ftpa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11223659_10152839223491673_4157924758096106429_n.jpg?oh=e1a499a66baf2fbbbf91494f31d869bc&amp;oe=579D6235\" width=\"100%\" class=\"align-full\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scontent.ftpa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11009106_10152839251451673_6006942358191927362_n.jpg?oh=c32f3835bb769e143bd530ba23850dec&amp;oe=57CE4E20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://scontent.ftpa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11009106_10152839251451673_6006942358191927362_n.jpg?oh=c32f3835bb769e143bd530ba23850dec&amp;oe=57CE4E20&amp;width=250\" width=\"250\" class=\"align-right\"/></a><a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com\" target=\"_self\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Skip Farrow in 1976 with note to my Mom, :I Love You</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<p>A year ago, I wrote \"Dedicated to the Memory of Skip Farrow\" at the top of this website and that is where it will forever stay. \u00a0<a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com\" target=\"_self\">This community</a>\u00a0is undoubtedly the most powerful thing that my father and I ever shared and it is for this reason, I'd like to tell you a few things you may not know about Skip Farrow.

Despite the challenges and the fact that many told me that it was \u00a0possible to build a community for surveyors due to the opinion that surveyors did not see the need to communicate across borders, I began building it anyway. \u00a0I have explained what I decided to do next in various other places so I won't rehash those ideas here. \u00a0In short, I started building this community in order for my dad to continue serving the needs of his buddies, help land surveyors find jobs and fix their equipment and ultimately become better surveyors. \u00a0It was that simple.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-4\"><strong>Related:</strong></span> \u00a0</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blogs/surveying-will-never-die-and-you-are-the-proof\">SURVEYING WILL NEVER DIE AND YOU ARE THE PROOF!</a></h3>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blogs/when-we-are-all-dead\">WHEN WE ARE ALL DEAD</a></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although I have managed to keep this network alive for close to a year by myself, the enthusiasm that my Dad brought to the direction of this community will be for the history books. Everyone else who helped in the early days has gone on to get better jobs and have less time to contribute as of late. I will not lie to you, It has been incredibly difficult to immerse myself in this community in the past year. Other surveying site owners have used this time to simply strip many of the best aspects of this community and repurposed them as their own for making money. Those of you <a href=\"http://goo.gl/Ca9isp\" target=\"_blank\">who have donated</a>\u00a0to help keep this community alive are true heros and you know who you are. $300 a month can be really difficult to come by as a graduate student. In that same light, \u00a0I am incredibly grateful to those who have helped me with moderation and admin duties while I finish my phd, attempt to keep it afloat financially and while putting yet the final final touches on the new and improved community. \u00a0To be honest, it may be hard for me to really get back into it until we move to the new platform. \u00a0There are just too many memories attached to this old clunky virtual environment. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You may have noticed that I changed my name here on the Network to Jaybird, which is what my dad called me all of my life. \u00a0When he was born 2 months premature in 1953, everyone started calling him Skip instead of Alan because he skipped two months. \u00a0He was an Alan Bradley and I was named Justin Bradley and so Jaybird is what he called me. \u00a0Most surveyors that I know in real life also call me Jaybird. \u00a0I need change in the most honest ways imaginable these days without him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-5\">What My Dad Would Have Wanted...Bright Lights</span></p>\n<p>If dad were still here, he'd be at home blasting the Marcus King Band and working on the needs of surveyors who needed his help. \u00a0He would be excited for all of the positive changes which are happening in the surveying industry. \u00a0 \u00a0He would want us to migrate to the new platform and he would want for us to have Survey Earth in a Day. \u00a0This is exactly what we are going to do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/782567225208901/\" target=\"_blank\"><img

They\u2019 re meant to collect more information for decision-making.<br/> To judge by experience, we can receive useful feedback from our dealers and customers, especially when there is a competitor. People may tell you that he is doing better than you in some aspects. But it was through a lot of research and questionnaire analysis that people got the experience. When you get that experience, your competitor has already made a new strategy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LyuHGbpgCtDDvhrhq9R44NqFEUQDM2bGKyJbUGNn**SP7pKwQJlG4EK6KArg6UTQlmrzMGquy9nNCA7inIXeiWu5ATawA-NS/calculatinghands.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/LyuHGbpgCtDDvhrhq9R44NqFEUQDM2bGKyJbUGNn**SP7pKwQJlG4EK6KArg6UTQlmrzMGquy9nNCA7inIXeiWu5ATawA-NS/calculatinghands.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\" class=\"align-full\"/></a><br/> <strong>Then what should we do?</strong><br/> In fact, you can get it from social websites , from e-commerce websites , from any corner of the place where your competitor may show on the Internet and collect any information you want. You can collect reviews on your products from customers. If you do a little statistical analysis, or use some visual-analysis tools, you will know what they exactly discuss. You can focus on the key words to understand your products from their views, including any of your promotional activities, how is the reputation behind, what they want you to improve.<br/> But before that, you need a web data extraction system. Actually we are just like you. We also have several strong competitors, including import.io and mozenda. And we don\u2019t even know exactly how many competitors out there. We also use lots of crawlers to crawl the places where our competitors gather, to investigate what people discuss on web data collection and questions that bother them. We gained a lot of information and try our best to solve every problem. We are more eager than anyone to make our product better.</p>\n<p><br/> <strong>How we do it?</strong></p>\n<p>We collect every reviews and discussion about web scraping from Facebook, Twitter, Stack Overflow, which help us figure out what their weaknesses are. So a free version is now available. The tool is free so that every one can have their own crawler to easily collect data. The way we make profit is very simple. If you need cloud servers for your data collection, you may try the service that will cost you a little. The standard version has 4 cloud servers and the professional version has 10, which will make the extraction easier.

The traditional ways of collection of data was time consuming and the productivity of the staff was at the best average. With the advent of new technologies like Mobile LiDAR Mapping, the collection, assimilation, analysis, design, construct, maintain and storage of data has become very fast, accurate and cost sensitive This dynamic system of mensuration can be used to acquire highly accurate and compact 3D statistics by safely driving a gathering vehicle at public road speeds<br/><br/>Mobile Lidar systems is made up of of four different devices: a laser, a scanner, a photodetector and a GPS/IMU positioning system. These four systems assimilate to measure the distance to an object by lighting the target with throbs of light from the laser instrument and gauging the time it takes for each throb to bounce back to the sensor. For the reason that light moves at a persistent and known speed, the distance between the laser instrument and an entity can be measured with a high degree of accuracy. A briskly firing laser can cover entire scenes in a few strokes, visualizing the topography and extracting data. A highly capable processing software then transforms raw data into colorful 3-D point clouds, and the end results are multifaceted, high-resolution maps.<br/><br/>Collection of detailed, high accuracy street-level data of street framework is expedited by having instruments capable of reading GPS/IMU on a automobile platform, achieving immense extents of GIS-friendly LiDAR point cloud data in short amount of time. Terrestrial LiDAR system is competent to see data flanked by buildings and under tree canopy, which airborne systems, will never be able to capture. Mobile mapping systems usually collect a full 360-degree FOV at a speed of 30-40 kilometers per hour. The data collected will be highly precise and can be used to generate convincing 3D data and highly accurate road maps.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br/>Geo-referencing factor of mobile mapping is akin in idea to airborne platforms, but distinctive in run through. It is not possible to keep the GPS lock all the way through an entire mobile survey. The mobile platform must be able to traverse, and accurately map, below tree canopy, under bridges, without loss of positional accuracy. The IMU system become judgmentally important. The airborne system necessities for GPS/IMU quality basically do not apply in these situations.<br/><br/>As is the case with every mapping application, supplementary imagery and substantial data post-processing is often crucial to producing GIS or CAD-compatible final products. The processing applications necessitate solid surfaces with unambiguously defined edges, and topologically-structured feature objects (points, lines, and polygons) with widespread data description and attribution. The time and effort involved in taking out these features from LiDAR point clouds has been a process only knowledgeable persons can work out. This needs special LiDAR/Point cloud processing software and custom data formats, as is for airborne or fixed systems, transfers over to mobile systems and is augmented by the steep quantity and intricacy of the data acquired.<br/><br/>Incorporation of mobile mapping data, generating exhaustive data for highways and metropolitan infrastructure) with mobile topographic LiDAR survey generated terrain models and oblique imagery is sure to turn into the gold standard for street mapping and visualization in the very near future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sblcorp.com/geospatial-services\">http://www.sblcorp.com/geospatial-services</a></p>\n<p>info@sblcorp.com</p>","createdDate":"2016-04-22T09:36:18.208Z","updatedDate":"2019-01-30T09:19:54.384Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2016-04-22T09:36:18.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:330552","contributorName":"1v3uuei9mle4c","title":"Top of Google Ranking - Free & Easy","description":"<h2>Getting to the Top of Google:</h2>\n<p>Have you ever wondered how to get to the Top of the Google Search Results for land surveying?

company survived our decision was to hunker down and survive the year by chasing projects outside the normal flow of work.\u00a0 I remember helping to test some robotic\u00a0equipment on Fort Sill, Oklahoma by providing survey data for the equipment and for targets on the ground they used to test their ability to fly to a specific point and photograph what was there.\u00a0 There were a variety of other odd things for us to do when site planning surveys and construction staking were not plentiful.\u00a0 It is important to expand our horizons and find things to do when the work does not come running to us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Slow periods are also a good time to invest in the future by taking time out for training with new skills we can turn into cash.\u00a0 I met a surveyor who decided to take a leap of faith and buy a robotic scanner and learn how to use it while\u00a0he had some time on his hands.\u00a0 The last time I visited with him he owned three of them.\u00a0 He expanded his

Remotely sensed images comprise of spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. The introduction of High-resolution satellite imagery is projected to reduce cost for medium and small scale topographic mapping. Since high-resolution satellite imagery has a much close-fitting field angle, the projection of images is nearly calculated by parallel rather than central systems. Using high resolution we can extract valuable information that will serve as a reference to bigger data needs and planning. <br/>The feature extraction stage is intended to obtain a solid, non-redundant and evocative demonstration of observations. It is accomplished by removing repetitive and irrelevant material from the data. <br/>SBL has perfected its capabilities in\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.sblcorp.com/gis-services/2d-feature-extraction\" target=\"_blank\">2D feature mapping</a> in the form of base mapping, land use land cover mapping and other types of thematic mapping.\u00a0 This kind of remote sensing services requires the knowledge of pre-processing on the satellite images. These pre-processing steps includes geo-referencing for geometric corrections and image enhancement for radiometric corrections.\u00a0 Digitally enhanced and geo-referenced images can be (re)projected to real world co-ordinate systems to put it in use for 2D feature extraction.</p>\n<p><br/>GIS data represents real world entities and features such as roads, land use, elevation, trees, waterways, etc. In GIS all features are grouped under the classes of point, line or polygons.\u00a0 Points are the smallest entity in GIS.\u00a0 Land marks, spot heights and point features such as locations of wells, ATM\u2019s etc. can be represented in the form of points.\u00a0 Lines constitute a series of points called vertices and nodes with a start point and an end node point.\u00a0 Transportation network, drainage network, telecommunication lines, power transmission lines, sewerage network and other utility and transport networks can be represented in the form of lines.\u00a0 Polygons are closed features in which a line has start point and end point the same and which will encompass an area within it.\u00a0 Parks, water bodies, residential areas and forests can be represented in the form of polygons. \u00a0</p>\n<p><br/>For 2D feature extraction services SBL will follow a classification schema derived after the requirement and need study established with the end-client.\u00a0 For example, for a forest department forest land parcels along with hydrographic and transportation network will be captured.\u00a0 For a mining firm during their replacement and rehabilitation process residential buildings, plantations, and orchards may be the main concentration.\u00a0 The thematic mapping using 2D features will be established as per the project and need requirements and is designed with a long term vision of serving the future changes and developments.</p>\n<p><br/><a href=\"http://www.sblcorp.com/geospatial-services\" target=\"_blank\">GIS mapping</a>\u00a0for 2D features extraction can be possible through aerial photographs as well.\u00a0 The features can be extracted using image interpretation keys such as tone texture, size, shape, association ext.\u00a0 SBL\u2019s experienced image interpreters will deduce the images to useful thematic categories based on the classification schema. The final stage of the GIS based mapping services is the cartographic layout preparation. Each and every mapped 2D features will be given with a suitable standard symbology and layout can be prepared based on standard cartographic norms.\u00a0 The above notes explains in general the 2D mapping approach adapted by SBL.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sblcorp.com/geospatial-services\" target=\"_blank\">SBL Geospatial Services</a></p>\n<p></p>","createdDate":"2016-03-29T07:16:11.778Z","updatedDate":"2018-12-15T15:13:43.386Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2016-03-29T07:16:11.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:322793","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"Features of the New Community","description":"<p>).</p>\n<div class=\"styled_table purple shadow\"><table width=\"100%\">\n<thead><tr><th style=\"width: 20%;\">Feature</th>\n<th style=\"width: 80%;\">What it\u2019s all about</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr><td><a title=\"activity\" href=\"http://www.ning.com/ning3help/introduction-to-the-latest-activity-feature/\">Activity Feed</a></td>\n<td>The big, up-to-the minute stream of latest activity across Survey Earth. .</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td><a title=\"blog\" href=\"http://www.ning.com/ning3help/multiple-blog-instances/\">Blog</a></td>\n<td>Blog posts are one way you and your members can express what\u2019s on your mind.

Philosophy\" class=\"align-right\"/></a>This semester, I am taking a comprehensive advanced business plan writing course, in which I am writing the plan for the long awaited new platform for Land Surveyors United. \u00a0As most of you know by now, my dad Skip Farrow passed away last June and because this network is something that we built together, I have been doing a lot of work on my own in attempts of getting the new site up and running. \u00a0While doing so a lot of time has been spent digging up pages and archived information about the site to create a more comprehensive and understandable reason for why we are all here. \u00a0For example, tonight I stumble across a page archived long ago which told the story of our community philosophy circa 2010 and I thought it might be interesting to see what you all think of it today. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0I am going to share it as it was written then and if you are interested, share your thoughts on how much has changed in the industry in the past 8 years</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><big>As a kid, I spent the majority of my time outside of school working in a reprographics shop owned by my father where surveyors and engineers were in and out all day. Somewhere along the line, I learned a lot about the needs of surveyors in getting their work done. At times, I worked really hard to help him meet deadlines by assisting with blueprinting, delivering and servicing equipment or whatever was necessary to get the job done. As an adult and college graduate, I found myself gravitating back to this feeling of obligation and commitment to the surveying industry,\u00a0<span>but why?</span><strong>Anthropology</strong>.</big></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong><big>Surveyors Need More than a Sounding Board. \u00a0They need a Community</big></strong></p>\n<p><big>In 2007, when I started building LSU, my goal was to reach a critical mass of activity amongst the members i had. My goal was to build slowly, for example I hoped for 5000 interactions per month at this time, because Land Surveyors United\u00a0<a title=\"ePalmetto Blog post announcing Land Surveyors United reaching 100 members\" href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2008/11/land-surveyors-united-reaches-100.html\" target=\"_blank\">had only 100 members</a>. But in the future I projected 25,000 interactions when LSU came to 500 members. At this point I began to finally start looking around at other social networks for possible ways of 'generating' interactivity and discussions, but discovered quickly that nothing these other communities were driven by could ever power\u00a0<span>a serious network of professional land surveyors</span>. And because no such online environment existed for surveyors, I had nothing else to work with or compare my vision to and thus, no other source of inspiration. The only online destinations where surveyors could congregate at this time were lacking the features that surveyors so desperately needed. \u00a0And with the advent of social media,<span>\u00a0someone</span>\u00a0needed to assume the responsibility of enlightening surveying professionals in the industry to the multitude of ways in which social tools can be used for building reputation and supporting one another online.\u00a0<span>I assumed that position</span>. \u00a0My inspiration would have to be based upon my own list of objectives. Those objectives were fuel by anthropology, not advertising.Surveyors communicate in highly specific ways- and those ways are not typical to other online social networks.\u00a0 I began to move away from the whole idea of building a \"social network\" for land surveyors and began to gravitate more towards a network built on \"social support\".\u00a0</big><big>Therefore I decided that a transformation of a social network environment into a social support system was the way to proceed with building a global community.</big><big>\u00a0\u00a0 Land Surveyors United should always be free to the individual surveyor and geospatial community\u00a0<span>because (in my opinion) surveyors should not have to pay for the following:</span><br/></big></p>\n<div class=\"layered-paper\"><ul>\n<li><big>Voicing an opinion on the surveying industry as a whole;</big></li>\n<li><big>Building a reputation online by sharing their expertise and experiences;<br/></big></li>\n<li><big>Finding Answers to their problems in the field;</big></li>\n<li><big>Finding updates, tips and tricks for the equipment that they already use;</big></li>\n<li><big>Ability to share what they know and do so with rich media.</big></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p><big>When I began building\u00a0<span>Land Surveyors United</span>, there were a few inherently counter-productive trends that seemed to be haunting the surveying industry.\u00a0</big></p>\n<ul class=\"layered-paper\">\n<li><big>Every time a surveyor tried to find support from a dealer, they always tried to sell them a new piece of equipment</big></li>\n<li><big>Every time a surveyor called the manufacturer for training and support, they told them to call a dealer.</big></li>\n<li><big>Every time a surveyor could actually find support, they needed to be at an office</big></li>\n<li><big>Every time a surveyor actually needed support, they were out in the field.</big></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"layered-paper\"><big><span><br/> <br/> Now, only five years later, Land Surveyors United has changed much of this in the surveying industry.</span></big></div>\n<div class=\"layered-paper\"></div>\n<div class=\"layered-paper\"><h3><big>Land Surveyors United has a National AND an International Voice</big></h3>\n<big>The lack of an\u00a0<span>effective</span>\u00a0international voice can be\u00a0</big><big>directly\u00a0</big><big>attributed to the fact that information that keeps surveyors informed in this industry has been monetized to the fullest extent.\u00a0 They want you to have to pay for it therefore they control it and release it upon payment. Surveyors (both\u00a0<a target=\"\" href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.visibli.com/2472f54c426b60fc/?web=e4af6c&amp;dst=http%3A//palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2007/03/magellan-ashtech-thales-zmaxnet-demo.html\"><em>new school</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>old school</em></a>) really should have direct access to one another and a place to utilize these tools of communication to both improve their business and build their reputation online. Surveyors are among the most technologically driven professionals in the world. And although the information that they gather day to day in the field is so vitally important to our understanding of the earth and our growth as a society, it isn't hard to imagine how difficult it must be for surveyors to stay up to date in respect to changes in technology. I hope to eventually have created a few useful avenues of exploration and sharing for the everyday surveyor. Communication among these valued professionals in the field, in my opinion, should not be limited to the outdoors. When the day is over and you're back at the office uploading data from the field, what better way to get advice, share stories and get support (<em>burning that company time</em>), than simply logging into an environment full of like-minded individuals who know what they are talking about? It takes a mere 5 minutes to set up a profile and announce who you are. \u00a0In the very least, you may have learned something new,\u00a0while preparing for new avenues of\u00a0<strong>networking</strong>\u00a0within the industry.\u00a0 On\u00a0<span>Land Surveyors United</span>,\u00a0our growing\u00a0<span>cross-cultural community</span>\u00a0is empowered to communicate across geographical borders and\u00a0</big><big>the language barriers have been transcended. \u00a0For the first time in history, member of the surveying industry are\u00a0<span>united</span>.</big><br/> <big><br/> Land surveying as a profession is the oldest in human history, as we all know.\u00a0 Surveyors use the most advanced technology and equipment known to man and day to day play the part of both the artist and the scientist.\u00a0 It should not be so difficult to get the information needed to learn the proper ways of utilizing the latest technological advances in this profession, but it is.\u00a0 That is why i created Land Surveyors United.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></big> <br/>\n<h3><big><big>History of Land Surveyors

CAN TALK, JUST DONT STOP WORKING","description":"<p>This happened over 25 years ago but I still remember it.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When I was an instrument man for a small surveying firm, I was new, young, and being trained by the party chief that had twenty years of field experience and was quite the outdoorsman. It was very hot outside, and we were way out in the county surveying a large tract of land. I had a good set up and the party chief was about 300 feet ahead of me with a prism pole. The rodman, who was also new on the job, had stayed back for whatever reason and we began a conversation. The party chief stopped working, and started walking the 300 feet back to my set up where the rod man and myself stood. I wondered why doesn't use the radio, and was confused on why he would walk 300 feet back to me when he just walked 300 out away from the set up location. When he arrived, he grabbed my forearm and got my attention and said \"I don't care if you talk on the job, I actually encourage it, however if you talk, I would require that you don't stop working while you talk\". That got my attention, and it stuck as a memory to this very day. Now, I see so many people that stop working when they start talking on the job. I think working is a skill, being able to work, while talking, is another skill.</p>\n<p><br/>Reprinted from\u00a0<a href=\"http://engineersupply.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">EngineerSupply Blog</a></p>","createdDate":"2015-10-15T19:08:46.887Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-10T01:52:28.020Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2015-10-15T19:08:46.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:307121","contributorName":"0m0ttvgt8t8u7","title":"How to Save Money Surveying your Own Land","description":"<p><span>You've decided that you want to save money and survey your own land. Maybe you just bought a piece of land, or inherited your grandfathers farm, or maybe you've had a dispute with a neighbor and you want to survey your own land to know where the boundary line is located. The idea is a great one, you pick up a few pieces of surveying equipment, take some measurements and you just avoided all the expense of hiring a land surveyor. You have been told by your friends that land surveys are expensive and large surveys for farms can be thousands of dollars so you instantly start thinking of ways to avoid that expense. You've heard that even a simple mortgage survey of a small city lot can be hundreds of dollars. You ask yourself, why pay such a hefty expense to hire a land surveyor when all you get is one small drawing. The idea is to get it done and save money by avoiding an expensive land survey fee. Just think, you could possibly solve neighbor disputes, know exactly how far back to build or place that storage shed, or just figure out how much land you own by establishing the property boundary lines. Stop and think of all the money you would save from surveying your own land.\u00a0</span><br/><br/><span>I could go on and on about the possible (the key word is \"possible\") benefits of surveying your own land would bring, but I want to mention a few things that you may not have thought of yet. If financing of any kind is involved, most banks require a legal survey to be performed by a licensed surveyor and without it, the bank doesn\u2019t truly know if your home or building is encroaching a boundary line. Wouldn't you rather show that the measurement is from a surveyor and not one you took yourself? Do you think that the bank or the neighbor that you had a dispute with would take your word over the survey you performed versus that of a professional land surveyor? Probably not since your measurements would be made by you and maybe considered bias or inaccurate. The trust gained from bringing in a third party for a land survey to establish a property line is huge. You, the land owner, most likely are not a licensed land surveyor that could not produce a legal document that would stand up in court with a land dispute, nor would any bank take your survey as a legal document if you were looking for financing either in a purchase or refinance. The legal side of taking this responsibility on I assure you is not something you would want.\u00a0</span><br/><br/><span>You may think that we as an equipment supplier is bias and would want you the land owner to buy surveying equipment from us but in reality we strongly suggest that you call your local surveyor and talk to them about what they do and what they can provide and how much it would cost. And, if there's more than one licensed surveyor in your area we recommend getting two or more quotes. Once you consider the cost of equipment such as a total station, computer software to bring your survey data in, analyze and draw a plat, the land surveyors malpractice insurance (yes, he or she carries the same insurance like a Doctor would), time spent doing the job, continuing education, and all other expenses like payroll and taxes, the land surveyors fees are relatively inexpensive and what we here at EngineerSupply consider a bargain. For a land surveyor to produce any profit, they have to survey many many jobs until they break even on the expenses I just outlined. A land surveyor has the education and experience to look for possible problems in your property boundary lines and legal description. A land surveyor usually starts the process with what is called Courthouse research which involves time spent looking up grantor and grantee with deed information as well as previous surveys recorded in map books. Now, when we come back full circle and think again, \"How can I survey my own land and save money\", we now know enough to make a better informed decision. The cost of surveying equipment, the cost of not having a legal survey, the representation we get from hiring a licensed land surveyor, and the cost of your land, it all boils down to contacting and hiring your local land surveyor. Now that you have a better understanding of the surveyors cost in what it takes him or her to provide all that he is providing the price of getting getting a legal survey is worth it. By hiring a surveyor, you don't have to buy the equipment, or spend the time doing the work, and you get so much more from a surveyor than doing it yourself, that this is what's called saving money.\u00a0</span><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Republished with Permission.

We're attempting to educate the public that surveys are not expensive, they are actually a heck of a great deal once you know what the land surveyors expenses are and what he is providing to you. Most people think a surveyor looks through a scope, prepares a drawing and that's it so they base their assumption that they think a land survey is expensive. Analogy would be more like the guy that buys a $12,000 lawn mower and mows his customers yards for $30 a mow. The customer doesnt have to mow grass, buy an expensive mower, spend his/her time mowing nor risk getting hurt. To me, thats a heck of a benefit to have if you need your yard mowed. Not the greatest analogy in the world, since mowing grass takes very little qualification or education as that compared to a land surveyor, but you get the idea.</p>","createdDate":"2015-10-14T20:05:11.675Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:307271","contributorName":"1xdey6hpo1161","description":"<p>If Surveyors are charging \"hundreds\" of dollars for a survey, then yes....it will take them MANY jobs to break even.

One such location is Grassy Lake in Hempstead County, Arkansas, about 20 miles northeast of Texarkana. Due to human impacts and an extended drought, the lake was suffering from depleted water levels. In order to maintain the pristine natural state of this region, biologists with the US Army Corps of Engineers required geospatial data to support their modeling and decision making.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\"></p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">The US Army Corps of Engineers Little Rock District turned to Continental Mapping to complete a hydrographic survey for Grassy Lake and the Little River. Project deliverables were to be used by the Little Rock District in their hydraulic analyses to better understand the effects of drought experienced in this area. The project team intended to perform a bathymetric survey of the lake via a boat and echosounder and conventional survey to control it in order to create a contour map of the current lake bed and compare that against historic 2007 lake levels. Upon arrival at the job site, however, the inhospitable environment quickly drove the field survey team to modify their approach.</p>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspect-ratio-fill\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*Bg5m3xwAOD3AZozZkko60A.jpeg\"/></div>\nThe project team had to handle with care while accessing delicate areas with exposed roots<br/>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Grassy Lake is an environmentally sensitive area filled with 350 year old cypress trees. One of the oldest cypress tree stands in Arkansas exists there requiring survey crews to take extreme caution when collecting data to not damage the trees. At one point in time the project area was entirely owned by a private hunting club, further limiting access. Extremely low water levels due to the drought made access to the exposed lake bed nearly impossible by boat or by foot. Access to the area was further complicated by dangerous wildlife including alligators which were concentrated in the now smaller open water.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\"></p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">The original technical approach for this project was to perform bathymetric survey using an echosounder throughout the lake and utilize conventional survey to gather ground control and cross-sections of nearby Little River. After arriving on site and evaluating the challenging environment and access issues, Continental Mapping proposed a solution to replace the bathymetric survey with aerial lidar. The aerial lidar was used to determine the exposed lake bed, and was merged with previous bathymetric surveys and compared with previous lidar missions to develop a contour map of the lake bottom. Utilizing aerial lidar was feasible in that acquisition could occur during leaf-on conditions. However, to ensure success the density of ground mass points was increased to saturate the area and increase the ground responses. This data was then used to compare the waterline from 2007 to the current, much lower waterline.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspect-ratio-fill\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*cMSs3cBoljKZEHEK8FfynQ.jpeg\"/></div>\nThese boats used to glide easily through water to where they rest in these photos.

Trimble Geomatics Office software was used to compute GPS data. Thirty ground control points were determined with a GPS/RTK survey. Cross sections were taken on Little River at the locations indicated in the scope of work. RTK survey methods were used to determine the river cross sections.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\"></p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">The data was calibrated and adjusted to project control with an RMSE of less than\u00a0.3ft. The resultant bare earth surface fell into alignment with the existing lidar mapping acquired in 2007 near normal pool. The previous waterline was used as a boundary with which to insert the new bare earth surface detailing the exposed lake bed. Contours were generated from the new surface at a 2\u2019 interval to illustrate the area from the 2007 water line to the current, much lower, water line.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">As a follow up to this project, additional cross sections of the remaining open water areas were taken several months later after rains brought water levels up. These were used to more closely approximate the volume of water within the lake and further aid hydraulic analysis.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Project Breakdown</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"></p>\n<h4 class=\"graf--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--h4-em\">Complexity</em></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">This project took place in a privately-owned, environmentally sensitive area, filled with dense vegetation and dangerous wildlife. The project area was nearly impossible to access by boat or foot due to historically low water levels. The team had to determine a solution to collect data in this low water period. It was decided that instead of collecting bathymetric surveys, airborne lidar would be collected at a high point density in leaf-on conditions and merged with bathymetric survey data from 2007 at the near normal water level. The resultant bare earth surface fell into alignment with past mapping data and the previous waterline was used as a boundary with which to insert the new bare earth detailing the exposed lake bed.</p>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspect-ratio-fill\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*tRJ6_MV-BucEt3rM-gu9sw.jpeg\"/></div>\n<br/>\n<h4 class=\"graf--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--h4-em\">Choosing aerial lidar</em></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">The original technical approach was for hydrographic, single beam cross-sections of Grassy Lake. After learning more about the project area and discovering that due to low water levels, access to the lake was nearly impossible, it was decided to collect aerial lidar instead. An on-the-site project call was made to swap out one approach for another and a plane was immediately mobilized. Efficient and effective on-site problem solving is often key to project success. In addition, using aerial lidar to collect points over the exposed lake bed and combining this data with previous bathymetric surveys provided a safe alternative to attempting to collect lake cross sections.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--h4-em\">Validating the use of lidar for environmental purposes</em></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"></p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">This project shows how aerial lidar is a viable method to study and display environmental sensitive or difficult to access locations. Comparing this study to previous years, allows an accurate display of changes in the water level and surrounding swamp vegetation.

Jones","description":"<p>The following story is fictional and any resemblance to actual events is purely coincidental.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://opentoadventure.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/indy-hat-and-whip.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://opentoadventure.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/indy-hat-and-whip.jpg\" class=\"align-full\"/></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Land Surveyor named Indiana Jones</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>One day I was sitting in my office in Downtown Houston around 5:00 pm in the afternoon in 2001 when the phone rang. \u00a0My secretary had already left and I was not anxious to answer it. \u00a0I had a comfortable practice running three field crews and another Professional Land Surveyor in the office. \u00a0I was daydreaming about maybe selling the business for a million dollars and just getting a<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span><span class=\"textexposedshow\">grass hut on the beach in Mexico and live out my days painting, writing and catching fish. \u00a0I had just become married to my second wife and was ready to head home.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">I picked up the phone and it was some Lawyers out of Dallas.\u00a0 They had a client who had experienced an event 1 hour north of Mexico City which may result in them being sued.\u00a0 They had sent a forensic team there but needed a Professional Land Surveyor to correlate the data they were gathering together in a coherent manner so an average juror would understand it.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">I was yawning and telling them I would send them a proposal in the morning when they interrupted me and told me they needed a Professional Land Surveyor in Mexico that night, they would fill me in if I agreed to do it.\u00a0 They were excited when I said that it was possible we could come to an agreement.\u00a0 After some brief negotiations and a few fax exchanges of paperwork I packed up one of the guns, a couple of prisms and a data collector, swung by the house, grabbed a change of clothes and headed to the airport.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">The jet got to Mexico City just after midnight and they unloaded my stuff into a taxi and the taxi driver and I headed up north through these winding roads into the hills.\u00a0 It was almost 2am when I finally got to the resort/hotel where the rest of the team was sleeping.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">I got a few hours sleep and then unpacked the equipment.\u00a0 I met the team around 7am who were eating breakfast in the courtyard of this very exclusive resort.\u00a0 The team consisted of the lead Attorney and his two legal assistants, an aviation expert, a fire investigator expert, a Civil Engineer and a couple of \"expediters\" who knew this particular area of Mexico very well.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">The lead Attorney laid out the plan for everyone for the day.</span>\u00a0 <span class=\"textexposedshow\">Apparently the local military dictator for the region had purchased a brand new 10 seater helicopter.\u00a0 He was going on a flight to film a region up in the hills that he wanted to develop into an industrial complex of some sort.\u00a0 He and 10 of his cohorts had flown into the ground a few miles away from where we were assembled, killing everyone aboard and the client had been denied access to the crash site by the Mexican police.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">Our mission was to access the crash site, gather as much data as we could on what happened without the local authorities knowing about it and then get out of Mexico without getting into trouble with the police.\u00a0 They had identified several areas including the crash site that needed to be examined by us over the last few days before the full team had arrived.\u00a0 We would head out towards the areas we needed to cover as soon as the locals showed up that the expediters had hired.\u00a0 The locals were to help them bribe the people living near where the crash had occurred so that they would not contact the authorities and tell them we were there.</span> <br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">Just about then a car with 4 or 5 locals showed up and pulled in behind a couple of trucks and a car parked next to the courtyard that apparently was our transport.\u00a0 I loaded up my equipment, everyone piled in and we set out toward the site.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">We drove way up into the hills and pulled into what seemed to be a small residential slum development nestled up in a mountain there. \u00a0It consisted of a collection of perhaps 30 homes or so sitting on the edge of this bluff. \u00a0Most of the homes were of the 2 story masonry variety with the typical courtyards surrounded by high masonry walls.\u00a0 The streets that wound through this subdivision were of dusty cobblestone.\u00a0 It was still early enough that there were not many people stirring and when we stopped the lead attorney got out of his car and came over to our vehicle and told us to sit tight.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">All the locals and the two expediters poured out of their vehicles and gathered around the lead attorney's car. \u00a0He opened the trunk and inside was football sized packages of money.\u00a0 The group fanned out into the neighborhood and after about 20 minutes or so one of the lawyers came over and told the rest of us to start unpacking our gear.</span><span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">The Civil Engineer was going to handle the prisms for me because he already knew a lot about the site.\u00a0 He was not sure how we were going to do the evidence locations however because of the tangle of buildings, walls and other obstructions in the area.\u00a0 There was a particularly large building on the edge of the development at the bluff that overlooked the entire subdivision and the slopes rising up to the site from the foot of the mountain we were on.\u00a0 I could see for miles from there so I ask if I could set up my gun on the roof of that building.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">Several locals went to the house with football size packages of money and in no time the building's residents vanished. \u00a0I lugged my gear up to the top roof of the building and set up.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">From this vantage point I started to see evidence of the scars this crash had caused to the neighborhood.\u00a0 The helicopter had struck a number of objects on its way down and I could make out a black spot in the earth roughly in the middle of this development near the intersection of a couple of these courtyard walls that were surrounding these dusty buildings.\u00a0 Everything seemed to be made out of concrete or masonry, even the utility poles which looked like they were holding up spider webs with the tangle of wires that were clinging to them.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">The Engineer started locating things of interest and I sketched it and collected the data as he went.</span> \u00a0\u00a0<span class=\"textexposedshow\">After a little bit the lead attorney managed to climb up to where I was perched and ask me to keep an eye on the main road and tell him if I saw any police or Federalies coming toward the little development we were in.</span>\u00a0 <span class=\"textexposedshow\">This made me kind of nervous but everything seemed to go very smoothly and I saw no people what so ever other than the team I was with.\u00a0 It is remarkable what football size packages of money can do in Mexico.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">Anyhoo after about 5 hours or so we were closing in on finishing but there was a site of interest some mile or more from where I was set up that needed to be located down in the valley below.\u00a0 It was some kind of antenna on top of a building and the Engineer took off in a car with a couple of locals and all the prisms I had.\u00a0 It would take every prism I had brought with me to measure such a long distance.</span><span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">I could just make him out clinging to the top of this building far down in this valley below as I got the measurement when I noticed a couple of open bed transport trucks winding their way up the main road from the valley below.\u00a0 I turned my gun on them and with some feelings of panic realized the trucks were loaded with soldiers.</span><span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">I relayed this info to the lead attorney who immediately told me to hurry up and pack up my equipment and get ready to leave.</span><span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">I did not need a second reminder and by the time I got to the truck with my equipment the rest of the team that was left were already ready to go.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">We sped down the mountain and passed the two military trucks going the other direction loaded with 20 or so Federalies who were headed to the site we were just at.</span>\u00a0 <span class=\"textexposedshow\">I was so relieved I nearly pissed in my pants when we picked up the Engineer in his car and started heading back to the resort.</span>\u00a0 <span class=\"textexposedshow\">I made it to the airport by late in the evening and was back in Houston by 1am that night.</span><span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">After compiling all of the known information about the crash a pretty gruesome picture emerged.</span><span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">The pilot of the helicopter only had 1 hour of flight time in this type of large machine.\u00a0 All of his previous experience had been with a 2 seater. \u00a0He had overloaded the craft with 10 passengers and a bunch of film equipment and was carrying a full load of fuel.</span><span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">Apparently he had been flying near top speed and swooped down toward this slope on the side of the mountain intending to fly along it but the machine was too heavy and continued heading toward the side of the mountain.\u00a0 He pulled himself up almost perpendicular to the ground in an effort to slow down but his tail rotor caught up an aluminum TV antenna that was on top of one of the taller buildings and this caused him to completely lose control of the machine.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">He managed to fly in an attitude almost perpendicular to the ground for well over a mile before slamming into the top of a building on this bluff in the residential neighborhood we had been at. \u00a0He hit the edge of the top of the building and lost his entire rear rotor boom which simply fell to the ground after sliding down the side of the building he had hit. The tail rotor flew off and stuck in the side of another two story building a block away.\u00a0 The main body of the helicopter slammed down on the roof of the building he hit and it slid on its skids right along the entire length of the roof and then got airborne again.\u00a0 It hit a 12 foot tall masonry arch in the courtyard and went right through it taking the top off.\u00a0 It sailed across the road and hit a concrete telephone pole at about 10 feet high. It broke it right in half and sent it end over end sailing into the air like a toothpick.\u00a0 It hit another masonry wall at the height of about 5 feet and went right through it.\u00a0 It sailed across another courtyard and hit the intersection of some walls where 4 separate courtyards met at about ground level.\u00a0 It did not make it through this time and burst into flames.\u00a0 To add insult to injury the concrete telephone pole he had clipped came down on top of the burning wreckage.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">I vomited right in the conference room when I viewed video tape of the crash cleanup later in Dallas.\u00a0 It looked just like a clam bake at a river campfire.\u00a0 It was hard to believe that the coals I saw were once a helicopter or that the charred hunks of meat they were removing from this burning pit were once human beings.</span><br/> <br/> <span class=\"textexposedshow\">People are always kind of surprised when I tell them I am a Land Surveyor.\u00a0 Most people have no idea what a Land Surveyor is and they think \"Mmmmm....did he say landscaper or....what a loser?\"\u00a0 And the fact is I thought the same thing before I came to the conclusion I was born to be one.</span><br/> <br/></span></p>","createdDate":"2014-12-02T12:12:14.078Z","updatedDate":"2016-05-26T01:29:00.039Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2014-12-02T12:00:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:289927","contributorName":"2m247gw4rh3xh","description":"<p>nice story Karl!</p>","createdDate":"2015-04-01T23:57:19.126Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:284297","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","description":"<p>nice post Karl!</p>","createdDate":"2015-01-28T00:31:03.810Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:282554","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","description":"<p>Wow.. nice post Karl!</p>","createdDate":"2015-01-07T21:26:16.299Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:279843","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","title":"CHAIN!

Land Surveyors are licensed to protect the Public and that is the only reason we are licensed. \u00a0While there is nothing wrong with offering products and services that don't have anything to do with Land Surveying, Land Surveying is a unique profession. \u00a0Unlike engineers, doctors or lawyers, Land Surveyors are not advocates for their clients.\u00a0 Land Surveyors have a greater duty to the general public than they do to any one of their particular clients.\u00a0 Our purpose is too stabilized and perpetuate Real Property boundaries both in the Public Record and on the ground. We are here to prevent litigation over Real Property boundaries and inform the Public about what they have Record Title to.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0There are at least two sides to every boundary that we survey and therefore Land Surveyors can\u2019t allow their opinion of a boundary location to be influenced by the wishes or beliefs of some particular client that is paying their fee.\u00a0 We must survey each and every boundary the same way we would if we were surveying it for the other side.\u00a0 If we depart from this code of conduct then that is when we cease being Land Surveyors and become something else.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Don\u2019t let these trade magazine pundits with a degree in hot air destroy the oldest and grandest profession of them all.\u00a0 Go forth and Land Survey and do it according to the Law in your location and in the Land Surveying traditions practiced by your predecessors at the location you are surveying. \u00a0That will save the profession of Land Surveying and not listening to some hot air artist who does not have the first clue what Land Surveyors really do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Come Ahead!</b></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>","createdDate":"2014-11-19T13:16:37.825Z","updatedDate":"2017-05-20T23:15:52.548Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2014-11-19T13:00:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:280974","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"Lucas like several other of these trade magazine pundits has been totally trashing specific Land Surveyors, the Societies that represent them and Land Surveying as a profession for years now yet they have been shown repeatedly over time to have been either completely wrong, mistaken or never comprehended the matters they wrote \"opinions\" on in the first place.

Mr. Hixson's article suggests that we must be all three. Either that or he doesn't understand junior and senior rights. Even title companies rarely go back in the chain more the 30 years. I've heard some old crusty title examiners claim that even though 30 years is the minimum, they will always go back at least 50 years. This wouldn't be good enough to\nresolve boundary issues to Mr. Hixson's liking. Just because the latest deed on an adjoiner was recorded in 1984 and the deed for the subject property was recorded in 1994, doesn't mean that the adjoiner has a senior interest in the land. In addition, calls for adjoiners in deeds do not always spell out senior rights either. One must track the chain back to the common grantor, which could be the original patentee, before junior/senior rights can be established. And what surveyor in his right mind wants to be writing opinions on rights into property in the first place? We are not trained in the law or licensed to do so. This is way beyond any standard of care and reaches into areas of incompetence. Unless he is also a practicing attorney, advising clients on their rights in property is malpractice......\nJeffery N.

Lucas flippantly questions requiring to trace title back to George Washington or the passengers on the Mayflower. His solution is to rely on a title officer or realtor with a fax message. Don't go back 50 or even 75 years and uncover the original deed with calls for a monument or a reference to a map by a deceased surveyor.\n\nMy limited experience in owning two homes in 50 years indicates the title company errs along with the rest of us. I examined the deed to a house I had lived in for several years before I was licensed. The prior owners had deeded their neighbor twenty-five and three-eighth inches to allow a garage to be built. The next deed shortened the word inches to two tick marks and the next deed changed it to one tick mark, or feet. Yes, the line moved into my living room. However the title company was not liable because they did not insure boundary lines.\n\nMany title companies go back to Square One which shows deeds made before the U.S.A. issued patent, sometimes belatedly at the urgent request of grandchildren who were attempting to probate the original homesteaders' estate.\n\n[Lucas's] attitude expressed in May certainly does not give credit to the parties who determined in Court record (Vol. 556 Atlantic 2nd Edition, page 1144) what was accepted practice in 1989. An interesting footnote is that two parts of New Jersey government dating back to the Duke of York presently exist merely to clear up title conflicts uncovered by current day resurveys or title searches. One meets in Perth Amboy periodically for East New Jersey, and the other in Camden for West New Jersey. Would a U.S. court claim jurisdiction over a dispute along the line between the two Jerseys divided along a north-south line by the Duke in the 17th century?\n\nRichard T.

Sounds like a good way to lose your license.\n\nThe professional surveyor chains the title as far back as necessary to find the appropriate first-cut deeds. Always. It has to do with junior-senior rights and the analysis of intent, not \"the King of England,\" or \"the Mayflower,\" or finding archaic deeds, as Mr. Lucas suggests.\n\nProfessional surveyors know what to look for in terms of deeds. (Lawyers and title officers, for the most part, don't have a clue.) If a surveyor is not willing to spend an hour or two at the title company to get the complete story, then maybe he should stick to technical surveying.\n\nBy the way, forget the courthouse. Most of their records are grantee-grantor indexed, and that takes forever. Good title companies have at least 100 years' worth of records in what they call \"arbitrary lot books.\" They're indexed by property.

Maintaining your safety or your field crew\u2019s safety as they <a href=\"http://ericcolburn.com/datugram3d-field-to-plan-in-action-surveying-a-pedestrian-bridge-across-a-highway-video/\" target=\"_blank\">work in and along dangerous roads</a>, on busy construction sites or at hazardous industrial facilities is paramount. Using conventional land surveying techniques and tools to ensure the occupational safety of field crews often adds complexity and cost to projects that can be reduced or eliminated entirely by surveying with cameras.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The National Safety Council reported in 2011 that over 100 road construction workers are killed in construction zones each year. About half of those worker fatalities resulted from a motor vehicle striking the worker. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also reported that deaths in 2010-2011 increased on roads, which made up 14% of the total traffic fatalities in 2011. As bad as those numbers are, this was an increase of 3% over the total traffic fatalities just a year earlier in 2010. Based on those figures and rising fatalities NHTSA predicted that every eight minutes a pedestrian will be injured and another one will die every two hours in traffic crashes!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Being able to remotely measure the locations of points found in hazardous areas using a regular camera is a quantum step forward in worker safety. There are many benefits to using close-range photogrammetry software like DatuGram\u21223D including improved productivity and better profits, but in my opinion there is no better reason to purchase and use an inexpensive, regular camera and DatuGram\u21223D than for safety alone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From my 30-years of experience surveying and from what I\u2019m hearing around the country from Datumate customers, here are a few examples of how land surveyors are using or planning to use a regular camera and DatuGram\u21223D to work more safely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Stockpiles \u2013 Stockpiles are inherently unsafe because of their heights and potential for shifting, unstable surfaces. For these reasons the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) does not want surveyors to be walking on stockpiles while performing their daily tasks, like topographic mapping of stockpiles to determine volumes. Being able to survey stockpile surfaces remotely using a regular camera, either elevated on a telescoping pole or with a small UAV, is a very efficient and safe process for your field personnel.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Trenches \u2013 Because of the risk of trench collapse and cave-ins, trenches can be extremely dangerous work zones that are heavily regulated by OSHA, and for good reason. As above with stockpiles, employing a camera to remotely perform as-built surveys of shallow utility installations is quick, accurate and completely eliminates risk because your workers need not enter into these potentially dangerous trenches.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Pipeline as-builts \u2013 Whether in trenches or elevated above ground, there are dangers and OSHA limitations to surveyors walking on pipelines. Using a camera elevated over a pipeline a surveyor can safely, quickly and accurately as-built the pipeline welded seams, for example.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Roadways and high-traffic areas \u2013 This is probably one of the biggest risk zones for surveyors on a daily basis. Having done a lot of surveying along and in roads and intersections, I can personally attest to just how dangerous working in and along roadways and high-traffic areas can be, having nearly been hit by automobiles on many occasions. Datumate has many use cases for surveying and mapping roadways and street intersections using a regular camera that completely eliminate the need to enter into these hazardous areas.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Hazardous electrical facilities \u2013 I was just working with a surveyor last week who was using a regular camera and DatuGram\u21223D to survey and map an electrical substation without needing to enter the electrical facility at all. I distinctly remember my first party chief warning us against using a steel tape to measure the chain link fence around a small electrical utility installation adjacent to a building we were surveying because he knew of a surveyor that was electrocuted and died doing similar work. Apparently, the electricity arced to the nearby surrounding fence and when the surveyor\u2019s steel tape touched the surrounding metal fence he was killed.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Hazardous industrial facilities \u2013 Industrial facilities are inherently dangerous places to survey due to their complex installations and oftentimes exposed, moving mechanical systems. It is clearly safer to use remote measurement techniques with a camera than to measure those same facilities directly.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/> <span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Additionally, because these are often complex sites, having the ability to easily measure new points in DatuGram\u21223D with the images you took in the field eliminates the need to re-enter a hazardous industrial facility to locate missing survey data using conventional methods.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hazardous material sites \u2013 I\u2019ve had several surveyors ask me to show them DatuGram\u21223D and how to survey using a regular camera specifically so that they can avoid entering contaminated hazardous material sites. First, they want to avoid entering and working in these highly toxic waste sites and, second, they are equally excited about not having to suit-up with bulky and inconvenient personal protective equipment!</p>\n<p><br/> The examples above are just a few cases showing where close-range photogrammetry using a regular camera and software like DatuGram\u21223D will improve the occupational safety of your workers. Using this new revolution of surveying with regular camera more than pays for itself for just one dangerous job site, compared to the cost of even one small injury, or worse, if there is an employee fatality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"http://ericcolburn.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">contact me</a>\u00a0to request an online demo or to learn more about how using a regular camera and DatuGram\u21223D can make your work safer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>-- Note: This article was written for the <a href=\"http://datumate.com\" target=\"_blank\">Datumate</a>\u00a0October 2014 Newsletter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>About Eric Colburn, PLS</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ericcolburn.com/work-with-me/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ugvao0mAfe4LIqhIsXT1oU6XMOGJxYH*QwoJ0rGZQzXuEs5g*LVaYcN-YRFKaRVqa-xALyA1teqerb*BdNQpOBUXyvGuCtwD/eric1243x300.jpg?width=100\" width=\"100\" class=\"align-left\"/></a>Eric Colburn, PLS, is a seasoned professional land surveyor, DatuGram\u21223D and AutoCAD Civil 3D consultant with over thirty years of experience.

I had forgotten about my old account over on Merchant Circle that my son set up for me during the darkest times of 2007-08.\u00a0 When construction went bust, so did my local business\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.merchantcircle.com/merchant/blog/preview/45692?referrer=viewArchive\" target=\"_blank\">built from the ground up</a> in Charleston.\u00a0 But while this was happening, Justin began working the hardest to help keep me up and build something positive which could unite all of the surveyors....not just the US, but\u00a0of the world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Justin had finished the College of Charleston with honors in Anthropology, he had also worked beside me his whole life in what ever i did...from Art,Reprographics, and Surveying. Plus he worked on a crew with South Star Surveying, owner Elliott Quinn, for about a year and a half just before college</p>\n<p>But at this time he had gone to New York to work on a Masters in Anthropology, when during a short visit to Charleston turned into a 3 year stay. No degree in computer science, but being the master researcher he is and communicator, and his ability to communicate with anyone, along with some friends from Google.He sat in the back of our building in the calibration repair room, started building and connecting Palmetto Equipment to the internet. It was very quick that Palmetto Equipment was epitomized and known by the search engines...our website was showing up all over the world. From morning until late at night we were being found on the internet from everywhere. All this growth we see now in Brazil, Poland,South America, the Middle East.....we were filling it then, back in 2008..I'm talking about my email filling up, and phone calls from around the world, and around the clock.This was so unbelievable, it was hard to explain to others just what we were doing. We became one of the very first to sale on EBay, Justin and Craig from craigslist were communicating regularly, as Craig was starting up Craigslist.com. This is just a few of the events taking place in early 2008. We felt the direct effects of the world starving for knowledge and help, desperate for support and not just the United States So as my local business was sinking, we were working harder helping others.on thing like how to design a profile for a road in the Himalayas, Poland, etc. for just one topic. Justin and I were gassed, his knowledge he had gained in college about cultures of the world sure was handy when becoming a world support center.The scary part was I didn't know everything,.. so where to gain the knowledge.(this is another blog, named \"It's more blessed to give, than it is to receive.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The strength of a global network of professionals who face similar challenges, yet are regulated by laws that differ geographically, we started to think,\u00a0 could just be the \u00a0thing which helps everyone involved. \u00a0 But we need to remember that in 2008, it was considered a weird idea in the US (online and in print) to wanna build a global network or start a community for a <em>worldwide audience of surveyors</em> because no one knew how to market to it. Much less, if starting a global market most would start small like a local market then grow to a global market. just the opposite for us, Our market was global before we knew it. That wasn't the mission.though. \u00a0The goal was to provide a level playing field where the students fresh out of school could mingle with the old guys and swap notes, where a guy or gal could track down a manual for equipment no longer supported or be the first to know when an upgrade for their software has been released.\u00a0 Surveyors needed a place to find on demand support for questions which can only be answered with experience and with experience comes expertise and with authority which can be built through shared knowledge comes ageless reputable advice and wisdom which becomes our legacy we leave upon the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"font-size-6\">The Past</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.merchantcircle.com/blogs/ePalmetto.Global.843-518-8488/2008/12/Land-Surveyors-United-is-Fastest-Growing-Network-for-Professionals/146115?c=735447\"><img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/JCg*7Qckn3OPP6-6mSOKIpeJsogE*GnztKyVkiSjG9zqqUaMSR7wDIfNxZgQdEhLjF*dwDtmtsR41DDegyWPUaVUCf41cPEs/lsuheadertitlebar.jpg?width=518&amp;height=112&amp;xn_auth=no&amp;type=jpeg\"/></a>The logo pictured above was Justin's first version of the LSU logo and the text pictured here was I believe the first time he began to mention 'Global' in the subtext, which was somewhat risky as it distanced our community from everything at the time Trade-rags magzines hadn't yet <em>gone social</em> and mostly catered to the guys who could afford the new innovations in tech and for this reason would rather ignore that such a thing as LSU exist, hoping we'd go away.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Search engines and online brand loyalty were not among the top priorities for equipment manufacturers, local boards and associations , definitely not for the owner/operator or small company owner just trying to get by with what he's got to work with.\u00a0 History shows that 2008 was the year my son became serious about initiating a process of change,\u00a0LSU something that he would always say when I ask him what he wanted to do when he grew up \"Change the World\" and he did not only for me his dad, but for a very specific niche of the human population.\u00a0 This change would bring about a gradual shift in the lives of those who contribute to it, give back to it and promote it, if not for any other reason than professional development. He took the path of most resistance and despite the fact that many of the big guys still have not yet publically ackowledges all of the good that LSU has brought to the industry and the socialization of their products and brands, you can bet your farm that they follow @landsurveyorsu on twitter and elsewhere.\u00a0\u00a0 Without asking for a dime in return,Justin has selflessly devoted his time to promoting brand awareness for respectable entities, many times better than the brands themselves. He built a place to solve problems with equipment that the manufacturers won't even support and most dealers lacking\u00a0 the knowledge\u00a0 of equipment which doesn't pay the bills, can't resolve and won't try.\u00a0 If you happen to work for a local society, board or a brand represented in our groups, just ask for the analytics for the past few years and you'll see a lot of traffic to your site has come from pages on this community bringing awareness to your resources, products and guidelines, unmonetized.\u00a0 Every entity represented equally, giving everyone equal opportunity to promote their goals. LSU was not your classified ads for equipment, nor a site that was supported by a brand of equipment or software,nor does it cost you to join or remain a member for a life time. Nor was it designed for Justin and I to be wealthy.it actually has been a passion and a lifestyle to continue building and support as large as it is.More to come on the growth and development of LSU</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<p>Anyway, i came here to share something .I just stumbled across a time capsule from December 7 2008, written in my Merchant Circle Blog, entitled <a href=\"http://www.merchantcircle.com/blogs/ePalmetto.Global.843-518-8488/2008/12/Land-Surveyors-United-is-Fastest-Growing-Network-for-Professionals/146115?c=735447\" target=\"_blank\">\"Land Surveyors United is the Fastest Growing Network for Professionals\"</a>, addressed to the founding members our community, then comprised of a grand total of 200 members.\u00a0 At the time, that was rapid growth, as most of you guys were not even using the web yet and social media was still in its primitive stages.\u00a0 The mobile revolution was on it's way and there was a lot of confusion in the surveying industry.\u00a0 A LOT of surveyors were out of work, but our\u00a0<a href=\"http://jobs.landsurveyorsunited.com\" target=\"_blank\">Surveying Jobs board</a> wouldn't be invented until 2009.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.merchantcircle.com/blogs/ePalmetto.Global.843-518-8488/2008/12/Land-Surveyors-United-is-Fastest-Growing-Network-for-Professionals/146115?c=735447\"><img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/8QOPGYNO0tjhmHtmXe6RtXeIBzjZqdVp9v6QFyLRiHH2WCO1RceLUXmF4D7rT43*gXgEryzbBvWKkGW9ccPbXFni3IMsJJ0Z/1future2008.gif\" alt=\"Land Surveyors United circa 2008\" width=\"100%\"/></a>It just shows how consistant the mission and growth of our network has been since 2007.

And for this reason, I ask a lot of relevant questions when someone signs up. Those who skip questions or enter \"I'll tell you later\" automagically get declined. \u00a0I tell you all this because I want you to know what is represented in this map. \u00a0I want you to know that this map which features you and your fellow surveyors is not an inflated representation of a number, but rather something that you should all be very proud to be a part of. \u00a0We are the first true global network of professional land surveyors anywhere on earth. \u00a0So far, everyone has been not only respectful to each other but most importantly to themselves by bringing such meaningful and useful conversations to this community and conducting themselves in a professional manner. \u00a0I cringe when I visit most other surveying sites which allow anyone to join and anyone to poison the production and progress. This is why LSU is so very unique and so far from any other example that you might be used to. \u00a0 And this is why your reputation is enhanced on this network, rather than clouded by invasive advertising, over embellished numbers \u00a0and garbage filled chitter chatter. \u00a0I build this network alone so that your content is not sensored by partners or politics.I find it kind of ironic that the site with no intrusive ads or reputation killing discussions happens to be the one with the least drama and the most membership diversity, don't you?</p>\n<p></p>","createdDate":"2014-07-03T02:30:02.100Z","updatedDate":"2018-05-30T06:50:29.981Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2014-07-03T02:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:266909","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","description":"<p><a

Ultimately the article is about <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">business succession</span>, but I might wander a bit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"font-size-3\"><u>In Memory of Allen Maxwell, PLS</u></span></strong></p>\n<p>First, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>William \u201cAllen\u201d Maxwell</strong></span> was a Professional Land Surveyor in the State of Alabama, a fact he was very proud of. \u00a0Allen started out long ago, as I did, working with my Dad, surveying in the Talladega county area of Alabama. We seemed to get most of the work on the most mountainous land in the area. Of course, with the beautiful Cheaha Mountains visible from our house, we were destined to spend a lot of time there. As the oldest brother, I blazed the trail for my other two brothers, Allen being the youngest. Our middle brother escaped and went to work with Delta Airlines, lucky duck. But Allen and I got land surveying in our blood. Allen worked for a short time building houses, did a stint with the Alabama Dept of Transportation, then with the City of Opelika as a surveyor. Everything just kept pulling him back to land surveying. When I started my business in Montgomery in 1991 he started part-time with me, then this turned into a full-time job when we moved to Auburn in 1993. For the next five years Allen worked with me to build up a pretty good business. But, the call of those mountains was too much when he got his license. He moved back to Munford and started taking over my Dad\u2019s business. Since then he has worked in the Talladega county area, continuing a long family tradition. He was well respected by folks he worked with, and had a slew of personal friends, in addition to two grandkids that he doted on. We buried him on the mountain, in a cemetery that he had recently surveyed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><strong><u>Following The Funeral</u></strong></span></p>\n<p>What happened after the funeral drove me to write this article. Allen liked land surveying, but HATED paperwork. As it turned out, this hated paperwork included a will, life insurance, accounts receivable, and organized client list. But, as a 49 year old man, in not too bad health, I can\u2019t blame him too much for not thinking too much about a will or life insurance. But, that little bit of paperwork would have saved his family quite a bit of expense and trouble.</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote><p><i>If you\u2019re reading this article right now and thinking about the fact that you don\u2019t have a will or life insurance, please put it on the TOP of your to-do list \u2013 for your family. NOW. Do it\u2026 Stop reading and write it down. OK, now continue reading.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><strong><u>A Written Witnessed Will is Necessary</u></strong></span></p>\n<p>A simple \u201cwritten witnessed will\u201d accomplishes two things \u2013 first, it appoints an \u201cexecutor\u201d or \u201cadministrator\u201d of your estate. This step is crucial. This person must be willing and able to go through all of your personal and business life and compile a list of everything you owned. In the will you can also allow this person to act without a bond. (Getting this bond is both complicated and expensive.) With no will, you have to ask the court\u2019s permission for someone to act as your administrator, and that person must furnish an administrators bond. Secondly, a written will directs your executor about who will receive your assets. Don\u2019t leave this to a judge to decide for you, get a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.lawdepot.com/contracts/last-will-and-testament-usa/\" target=\"_blank\">free will form</a> from the internet.\u00a0 If you have a large estate, then a will allows you to employ a number of relatively easy tax planning devises to save on federal estate taxes. (Not a problem with our family.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"font-size-3\"><u>Debts &amp; Debtors</u></span></strong></p>\n<p>Thankfully Allen only had one debt on a house he was renting out. The bank (who shall remain nameless because I\u2019m sure they\u2019d sue me) called their lawyer to discuss foreclosure the DAY that he died. Cold hearted bastards? Yes, but they have a right to protect their interest too. Again, an executor could step in and assure the bank that there was a plan for this loan. In this case, the loan was less than the value of the home, so we will be able to sell it and pay off the debt \u2013 AFTER we get an executor and a bond. In the mean time we have to continue paying the monthly payments. Again, our situation is VERY simple compared to others, I\u2019m sure. In considering what my relatives would have to go through, I feel sorry for them. This is where a life insurance policy would come in handy. A Term Life policy, which matches the term of the loan, would be able to pay off the loan for your family. And Term Life policies are the least expensive kind.<a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/OsG-NixX39cj5WSUyRdiGOWGBwsfhfH128lVkMvJvvAYnerdcF9neRJDUDNiHsj5Im8JDPcUAG9Iq6dsr9UxzwRWp2gKhg5Q/WilliamAllenMaxwellBirthday49.jpg\"><img class=\"align-right\" style=\"padding: 1px;\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/OsG-NixX39cj5WSUyRdiGOWGBwsfhfH128lVkMvJvvAYnerdcF9neRJDUDNiHsj5Im8JDPcUAG9Iq6dsr9UxzwRWp2gKhg5Q/WilliamAllenMaxwellBirthday49.jpg\" width=\"360\"/></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><strong><u>Business Succession Plan</u></strong></span></p>\n<p>The next issue that came up is that Allen\u2019s business was solely dependent on him, as the licensed surveyor, in order to be viable. Without a licensed surveyor, Maxwell Land Surveying couldn\u2019t carry out its day to day operations. This is the case with most any professional business. Non-licensed employees or heirs cannot continue to run the business. Therefore, there is a great need for a business succession plan. What is the plan? That\u2019s for you to decide. Maybe you have a business acquaintance that you could form an agreement with to purchase the business in the event of your death. They might want the same from you. Maybe you have a family member (like me) who is also licensed. Have a plan in place so this isn\u2019t a lot harder than it needs to be. I could let my brother\u2019s business go away \u2013 with all of the good will, the 50 year old phone number, the old files, and the client list vanishing into oblivion. \u00a0But, to help my brother\u2019s family, I\u2019m going to have to go through the courts and make an arrangement for the purchase of the business in order to keep it running. Again, a will that spelled out what you want to happen to your business is a must. And a life insurance policy would give some needed cash to take care of the employees and pay the business debts during the transition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><strong><u>What If You Don\u2019t Die, But You\u2019re Disabled?</u></strong></span></p>\n<p>I hadn\u2019t thought about this one at all until my sister brought it up. So, you have a will, and life insurance. But what if you don\u2019t die, but you can\u2019t work. Granted, with the little field work that I do now, unless my brain is affected, I can still order people around. But, what if my brain is affected? Your plan is not complete unless you take disability into account. There will also be a transition period here. And, you\u2019ll definitely need someone you can trust to carry out your wishes. There is a type of insurance called \u201ccritical illness\u201d which can cover critical illnesses, chronic illnesses, and terminal illnesses. There\u2019s also disability insurance. Look into these. Euthanasia is not a legal option yet, even though that\u2019s what I suggested to my sister if I was brain injured.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In conclusion, the most important thing you can do for your family and/or business is to have a Written Witnessed Will. Secondly, carry the most life insurance you can afford. Thirdly, develop a business succession plan for your professional business. And, don\u2019t forget to think about the possibility of your disability. I know that this seems like it turned into an ad for life insurance, but believe me, cash is much needed by your family after you die.

I was 32 at the time and thought that I knew everything about <strong>Land Surveying</strong> because of my previous experiences. It goes to show you that arrogance is most often a result of ignorance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As I look back now I realize that I had no idea at that time what I was doing and I am really uncertain at this point how I managed to survive in the beginning. After a couple of bumpy years however the business began to pick up dramatically. The quality of my product began to improve enough that my practice became sustainable. I quickly gained a reputation as being honest and thoughtful. I was thorough and took time forming an opinion that I could support with the facts. As a result of this some of my clients were on the rich and famous side of things which was a source of great pride for me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One day after a few years in my own business I got a call from an extremely wealthy client who owned a billboard advertising company. He said he needed a survey performed on a property about an hour from the center of the town I was working in. There was nothing unusual about this and he had ordered many other surveys from me in the past. I dispatched a field crew and later even visited the site myself to make sure of all of the evidence. Once again there was nothing unusual about this. The property was in fact vacant save an old billboard at the very edge of the subject tract boundary. The only noteworthy thing about the survey was that that the house on the adjoining property and the billboard were less than 2 feet apart with the boundary of the properties running between them. Somebody had cut notches in the eave of the roof of the house that corresponded with the location creosote wood posts on the billboard even though the edge of the roof of the building and the sign posts were both wholly within their own property and did not touch. As far as I could tell the sign was perpendicular with the earth contrary to what the notches in the house roof indicated. I thought maybe somebody was being careful worrying that the sign may start leaning into the house because violent storms were common in this area. The sign looked like it had been there for a thousand years and I could see nothing indicating that it had anything done to it in years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I delivered the survey to my client, collected the money and never thought anything about it until I received a phone call from the owner of the billboard advertising company some three weeks later. He informed me that they were in a legal battle with the adjoining property owner with the house and the local City government. He said the adjoining property owner claimed the billboard was on his property and the City government was claiming he had violated a City ordinance for working on the sign. He wanted to hire me to be an expert witness for him and he wanted to see if I was free the next day for the beginning of the trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A wave of different emotions swept over me all at once as I listened to him on the phone. First off I was a little upset that he had not told me this was being litigated when I went out to survey it in the first place although I gave him the benefit of the doubt that this matter may have just arisen. The thought of being chosen as an expert witness in yet another legal contest caused my ego to inflate my brain with hot air so fast all the cells were forced out through my ears causing temporary hearing loss. I was angered that <em>some other Land Surveyor</em> would be suggesting my survey of the property was incorrect since I always went way overboard with a search for evidence. I could not fathom a scenario where new evidence the <em>other Land Surveyor</em> might have would be able to overcome the evidence I had found on or near this site locating the boundary of the property.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I agreed immediately to be available and asked to talk to his lawyer and see any evidence that the other Land Surveyor may have. My client faxed me copies of the material sent to him by his lawyer along with his lawyer\u2019s phone number. I reviewed the material late into the evening to try and prepare for the trial the next day. A nagging question kept tugging at me which was why they had not contacted me sooner or why they had not told me about this litigation to begin with when I was hired to do the survey on it. These questions evaporated from my mind when I was reviewing the survey performed by the opposing Land Surveyor and realized that it was substandard and violated State Law. It contained the incorrect reference for the recording information on the face of the survey. It failed to show controlling monuments or much of anything. All it did show was the billboard over the boundary in question. I went to bed confident that I would be able to discredit the other Land Surveyor at the trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I woke up early the next morning and got to the trial early so I could get a word with my client\u2019s lawyer. I tried calling my client\u2019s lawyer but just got his voice mail. I got to the courthouse early but the lawyer, client and his witnesses did not show up until the last second.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I sat awkwardly on the defendant side of the courtroom alone while on the other side a small army of lawyers for the City and the adjoining property owner and their witnesses sat. I could not tell who the Land Surveyor was I was facing because there was nothing distinguishing him from everyone else on that side. I started sweating as people on the other side kept looking over at me all alone smiling as if to say \u201cwe are going to bury you\u201d. I nervously fiddled with all of the files, drawings and other evidence I had brought with me and drew some comfort from the fact that apparently the other Land Surveyor had brought nothing with him because nobody on the opposing side had anything with them. This gave me confidence that I was going to get my point across no matter who the other Land Surveyor was. Just a moment before the trail started my client, his lawyer and his witnesses came pouring into the courtroom. My client had a small army to match the other side and this boosted my confidence even further. The client seemed defiant and his lawyer confident as I was hustled out of the courtroom to wait my chance to testify.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I identified the other Land Surveyor when he was called to testify. As he came walking out of the courtroom afterward he appeared to me to be old and disoriented which made me think once again that I was doing the right thing with my plan to expose his survey as substandard. I was jacked up when I was finally called and as I walked past my client\u2019s lawyer to go to the stand I bent down and whispered into his ear asking him to quiz me about the other Land Surveyor\u2019s survey. On the stand my client\u2019s lawyer took my advice and I proceeded to crucify the other Land Surveyor for the various deficiencies in his survey. I began to list the violations of State Law which caused the opposing lawyers to object however I had a copy of the law sent to me by the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying among the items I had brought. My client\u2019s lawyer took that from my hand and introduced it into evidence and that is when the judge stopped the trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>She called me back into her chambers and asked me if I was going to continue attacking the other Land Surveyor. I said I was and told her I would continue until I broke his arm off and totally discredit him if they continued to let me testify. She called the lawyers from the two sides into her chamber and asked me to sit in on the bench in a small hall on the side of the courtroom just outside the door of her chambers and wait for them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As I sat on the bench I could barely hear the Judge telling my client\u2019s lawyer and the opposing council through her chamber doors that she was going to have to stop the trial and render a judgment in order to save the opposing side embarrassment. I was filled with pride and the thrill of victory listening quietly in the small hallway when my somersaulting ego was interrupted by some snickering and laughing from some people just a few feet away.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The waiting area in front of the main courtroom doors was just around the corner from where I was sitting and apparently a couple of my client\u2019s employees who had been waiting to testify were sitting on benches in front of the courtroom just out of my eyesight. They were talking about the trial but I was having difficulty hearing what they were saying even though they were laughing loudly because they were trying to not let anyone hear what they were saying. I edged a little closer and heard one of them say to the other \u201cour boss is a genius\u201d, the other said \u201cYea, he really pulled the wool over these suckers eyes.\u201d The snickering rose as I edged even closer to the corner to hear them better. \u201cThat plan of his to go out in the middle of the night and straighten the sign and move it onto our property was too bold, I mean what if the tenant living in the house had heard something?\u201d The other replied \u201dYea, but they never woke up and nobody is the wiser, that is the quietest I have ever heard you work.\u201d They once again broke out in loud laughter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I realized that the other Land Surveyor\u2019s survey was correct and that my client had been lying to me all along. I had destroyed another Land Surveyor\u2019s reputation on technicalities when in fact it was I who had been wrong. At first I was horrified and embarrassed but then another emotion started crowding into my mind. A wave of anger began to rise through me and I almost got up to go around the corner and confront them but at that moment my client\u2019s lawyer and the opposing lawyer came out of doors of the judge\u2019s chambers into the hallway I was sitting in and my client\u2019 lawyer leaned over as he was passing and patted me on the shoulder saying \u201cit\u2019s all over, we won.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I walked out of the courthouse in kind of a fog trailing the entourage that was following my client. They were all congratulating him and slapping each other on the back. The group stopped at the street to wait for the crosswalk light and that was when I took the opportunity to push my way through the crowd to my client. \u201cDon\u2019t ever call me again\u201d I told him. \u201cYou lied to me and you caused me to ruin the reputation of another Land Surveyor just for money, you are no client of mine\u201d I said to him angrily.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He looked at me kind of bewildered and then looked at the bewildered faces of each of his employees and lawyer in the crowd surrounding us then looked back at me and broke out laughing hysterically. Everyone else began uproariously laughing as the light changed and they all filed past me as I stood with an expression of rage not moving. The whole group walked off across the street and down the sidewalk laughing and grinning continuing with their celebration, one of the people in the group turned back to look at me as they followed and shot me the bird with his middle finger.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I got several phone calls from them about work I had done previously and they also asked me to bid on some new projects. I always sent back a message saying I was not interested in providing a service and product to them. After a few months the phone calls ceased and I never heard from them again. As a few years of practice stretched into decades of practice my peers, clients and detractors have all said many things about me\u2026.but one thing they don\u2019t say is that I lack integrity. This mind set of mine has limited my practice for many years but I will never be bitter about that. For me living a life of virtue was far better than living a life of deception no matter what. When it is all over I can always say, like Frank Sinatra said,\u2026.\u201dI did it my way!\u201d</p>","createdDate":"2014-05-07T13:22:57.983Z","updatedDate":"2018-04-09T12:16:31.052Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2014-05-07T13:00:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:261427","contributorName":"2h4f24o034agi","description":"<p>Thanks Deward for sharing your experiences.

As an example for the USGS National flood inundation mapping science initiative a professional survey level data layer would be of great benefit to help determining exactly which structures in or out of the flood zones. Greetings my name is John W. Veatch. I am a land planner, a professional land development engineer, professional land surveyor, Florida Realtor and I suppose because I have been issued a patent by the US Government you could call me an inventor of GIS (geographic information systems). My partners and I are about to launch a flood mapping pilot project in S.W. Florida. My patented system uses conventional land surveying instruments, GPS, Lidar and HD computer rectified 3D aerial imagery to product land survey maps. This process has been used for land title surveys for commercial transactions from Baltimore MD. to Palm Springs Calf. Our companies have been involved in this technology for the past two decades. We have produced over 140,000 land title surveys and collectively we have provided over $40 million dollars of GIS data for Government clients such as the states of Texas, New York, Michigan, Virginia, local governments including Los Angeles county, the Dallas/Fort Worth municipal area and major utilities such as PAC Bell. We are now about to launch the next level of information technology that will add the layer of information to these systems that will have the force of the law behind it. We have now incorporated 3D into our system and this technology has opened the door to several new business opportunities for the companies that use our surveys.

This is a draft copy, I am still working on it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>SURVEYOR\u2019S REPORT</h3>\n<p>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p>Land Surveyor has been provided copies of several surveys of properties adjoining the subject tract as well as a copy of a survey performed on the subject tract. In this Land Surveyor\u2019s opinion these surveys all appear to be in error for various reasons.</p>\n<p>Land Surveyor was provided with a Title Insurance policy which describes the subject tract as Lot 50, in Block 250, Houston Lows (Houston Lows), recorded in Volume 10, Page 1140 of the Map Records of Harris County, Texas. The adjoining subdivision to the west of the subject tract is Block 10 of Harding Lows (Harding Lows), recorded in Volume 7250, Page 3070 of the Deed Records of Harris County, Texas.</p>\n<p>There has been confusion for a number of years regarding the location of the true boundaries of the Lots and Blocks within the Houston Lows for this particular tier of Blocks which the subject tract lies within. There has also been confusion for a number of years as to the location of the Lots and Blocks within Harding Lows. This compounding confusion has led to a condition whereby the location of the possession of lands in the general area where the subject tract is at do not agree with the location of the Deeds these lands were acquired under.</p>\n<p>The various roots for this confusion can be explained as a combination of poor Land Surveying, errors by the Harris County Appraisal District, errors in conveyances of these lands and incorrect assumptions by individuals and Governmental entities seeking to possess lands within the area where the subject tract is located at.</p>\n<p>Below is a brief explanation of how the deeded boundaries of the subject tract were located by this Land Surveyor. Since the subject tract abuts Harding Lows, how its boundary was located by this Land Surveyor is explained below as well. In addition there is discussion below on how the confusion mentioned above came to exist regarding the location of the subject tract.</p>\n<p><strong>HOUSTON LOWS, TIER OF BLOCKS SUBJECT TRACT IS LOCATED WITHIN</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned above Houston Lows is recorded in Volume 10, Page 1140 of the Map Records of Harris County, Texas. An examination of the Houston Laws map shows Block 250 as being located on a tier of Blocks at the westerly edge boundary of Houston Lows map. Many of the Blocks in the Houston Lows map are depicted as having two tiers of Lots running in a north/south direction with a 15 foot wide alley in between them, said Blocks being surrounded on all sides by 70 foot wide streets. The Lots on the west side of Block 250 are depicted as being 132 feet in depth in a east/west direction. In the case of this tier of Blocks that Block 250 is located in there is no 70 foot wide street depicted west of it on the Houston Lows map. Instead the Houston Lows map depicts a 6.95 foot wide strip on the west side of Block 250. It is apparent that the original intent of the Houston Lows map was to have the adjoining land owner to the west of Block 250 dedicate the rest of the 70 foot wide street. However this never occurred. This meant that there was no access to the Lots on the west side of Block 250 other than by the 15 foot wide alley on the east side of these Lots or the 6.95 foot wide strip on the west side of these Lots.</p>\n<p>At some point there was an attempt to fix this problem and a map was filed for this area called \u201cMap of Blocks 147, 148, 149, 150, 247, 248, 249, 250 and 275 Houston Lows\u201d (replat) recorded in Volume 900, Page 2770 of the Deed Records of Harris County, Texas. The replat states \u201cfiled for record March 3rd 1896.\u201d The replat depicts the Lots on the west tier of Block 250 as being 120 feet wide in a east/west direction and widens the 15 foot wide alley running through the center of Block 250 to 40 feet. The replat names the new 40 foot wide street it creates \u201cScrewed.\u201d Apparently once the replat was filed it was then forwarded to the Harris County Apprisal District which then changed the tax mosaic to match the replat and not the original Houston Lows map.</p>\n<p>The replat however was in error. The original map of Houston Lows depicted a 15 foot wide alley, 132 foot deep Lots and a 6.95 foot wide strip on the westerly part of Block 250. This adds up to a total distance of 153.95 feet from the east edge of the 15 foot wide alley to the west edge of the map. The replat depicts a 40 foot wide street and then 120 foot deep Lots on the west side of Block 250. This adds up to a total distance of 160 feet from the east edge of the 40 foot wide street to the west edge of the map. In other words the replat created a 6.05 foot wide overlap with the adjoining lands west of Houston Lows map. This must have created conflict on the ground if subsequent Land Surveyor attempted to locate Lots on the west side of Block 250. Subsequent conveyances for Lots on the west side of Block 250 were made (or have been made in the past) using the original map (recorded in Volume 10, Page 1140 Map Records of Harris County, Texas) rather than the replat (recorded in Volume 900, Page 2770 of the Deed Records of Harris County, Texas), more than likely, to avoid this conflict. This can be evidenced by the description of the subject tract listed in the Title Insurance policy provided to the Land Surveyor.</p>\n<p>Subsequent Land Surveyors attempting to locate Lots on the west side of this tier of Blocks in many cases apparently used the tax mosaic dimensions and the dimensions from the replat even though the conveyances they should have been locating were from the original Houston Lows map. This can be evidenced by the previous Survey of the subject tract dated 04/01/11 provided to the Land Surveyor (there are other multiple errors on said Survey). This resulted in uncertainty as to the location of Screwed Street (because the Land Surveyors found the west tier of Lots and Screwed Street 6.05 feet shorter than they were supposed to be according to the replat) in Blocks north of the Block the subject tract lies within. This can be evidence by the survey provided to this Land Surveyor on Lot 51 Block 250 dated Oct. 15, 2012. The survey depicts Lot 51 as having a depth of 114.08 feet and 114.12 feet respectively in an east/west direction while the replat it purports to be locating the Lot from depicts Lot 51 as being 120 feet in depth in an east/west direction. Again approximately a 6 foot discrepancy (there are other multiple errors on said Survey).</p>\n<p>The confusion as to the location of the Lots on the west tier of Block 250 were in part hidden by confusion as to the location of Lots and Blocks within Harding Lows. This confusion is discussed below.</p>\n<p><strong>HARDING LOWS</strong></p>\n<p>Harding Lows subdivision was performed by Banes (RPLS No. 10). This Land Surveyor has retraced Banes work many times over the last twenty years of practicing Professional Land Surveying in Houston, Texas. Banes\u2019 work was typically very good and there seems little doubt that the original monuments, lines and locations shown on the \u201cHarding Lows\u201d subdivision map were correct at the time Banes completed his work on it.</p>\n<p>It is unknown if any of Banes\u2019 original monuments have been located by this survey however the location of the original lines shown on \u201cHarding Lows\u201d subdivision seems certain by evidence found and shown on this survey.</p>\n<p>It appears that the location of Wacked Street at 18th Street on \u201cMessed Up Place\u201d (recorded in Volume 6550, Page 6110 of the Deed Records of Harris County, Texas) may have been mistaken as the location of Wacked Street as it passes into \u201cHarding Lows\u201d. Banes\u2019 map of \u201cHarding Lows\u201d clearly shows a 10 foot jog to the east as Wacked Street passes from \u201cMessed Up Place\u201d into \u201cHarding Lows\u201d and it appears that subsequent Land Surveyors failed to take this into account and projected the location of Wacked Street from \u201cMessed Up Place\u201d into \u201cHarding Lows\u201d causing a 10 foot shift in possession to the west from the original location of Wacked Street shown on \u201cHarding Lows\u201d.</p>\n<p>Apparently some subsequent Land Surveyors attempting to retrace Lot locations within \u201cHarding Lows\u201d pushed this error northerly through parts of the east side of Block 20 and parts of Block 10 of \u201cHarding Lows\u201d.<br/> <strong>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>\n<p>The conditions in Harding Lows created a compensating error hiding the problem with the Houston Lows map versus the replat.</p>\n<p>Land Surveyor is unaware of any conveyance for the widening of Screwed Street to 40 feet from 15 feet wide other than the replat mentioned above. Since the conveyance for the subject tract is from the Houston Lows map and not the replat then Screwed Street would have a recorded width of 15 feet. This means the extra 25 feet the paving and utilities known as Screwed Street is occupying on the easterly side of the subject Lot is an apparent roadway and utility easement. This 25 foot wide apparent roadway and utility easement is presumed by the Land Surveyor to have ripened into an unwritten right vested in the Public. Further Governmental entities such as the City of Houston or quasi Governmental authorities like Centerpoint Energy could argue that they \u201caccepted\u201d Screwed Street at a total of 40 feet wide as shown by the replat which was filed for Public Record. In any case it would be unlikely that the owner of the subject tract could successfully claim to be the dominant tenant or fee simple owner of any land currently occupied by paving and utilities known as Screwed Street.</p>\n<p>Since the subject tract was conveyed under the original Houston Lows map then this would leave a 6.95 foot strip adjoining the westerly line of the subject tract in theory still owned by the Public. The 6.95 foot wide strip apparently has never been accepted by the Public. Land Surveyor recommends that the owner of the subject tract approach the City of Houston for a Quit Claim Deed for the portion of the 6.95 foot strip directly adjoining the subject tract to the west. If the City of Houston denies that a 6.95 foot strip exists as shown on the original Houston Lows map then Land Surveyor recommends that an Affidavit of Ownership and Possession be filed by the owner of the subject tract with the County Clerk for the portion of the 6.95 foot strip directly adjoining the west side of the subject tract.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how the question of the 6.95 foot strip is handled this would still leave approximately 3.6 feet of a two story garage/apartment protruding on portions of Lot 190 and Lot 200 in Block 10 of Harding Lows. This would also leave a wood fence protruding approximately 5.7 feet into portions of Lot 190 and Lot 200 in Block 10 of Harding Lows.</p>\n<p>Land Surveyor recommends that the owner of the subject tract approach the owners of Lot 190 and Lot 200 in Block 10 of Harding Lows and form an agreement as to the location of the true boundary line between them. Such an agreement should be reduced to writing and filed for Public Record with the County Clerk.<br/> Job No. H13171</p>\n<p>Preliminary, this document shall not to be recorded for any purpose and shall not be used, or viewed or relied upon as a final survey document<br/> ____________________________<br/> Deward Karl Bowles<br/> RPLS No. 4966</p>\n<p>This report is based on and attached to the Land Title Survey and plat made by Deward Karl Bowles No. 4966 Registered Professional Land Surveyor on September 18, 2013.</p>","createdDate":"2013-09-19T12:39:58.944Z","updatedDate":"2018-02-04T20:48:07.686Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2013-09-19T12:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:247610","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"Thank you Jim.","createdDate":"2013-11-10T03:49:47.374Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:247764","contributorName":"0aerehuak2l4u","description":"Good stuff...","createdDate":"2013-11-09T11:37:33.966Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:244948","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"I agree mr.

I had not performed a survey in this particular subdivision but had surveyed other tracts of land in adjoining subdivisions many times. I was fairly certain it would not pose much of a challenge although the description was for a couple of Lots and a fraction of a Lot. A written contact was negotiated and then signed by the client and a field crew was dispatched to the site.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The field crew came back with a fair amount of evidence but it was conflicting. No matter what evidence projection was employed I could not resolve the boundary and reconcile the improvement locations. I began to take a harder look at the record to determine who the original Land Surveyor was and who surveyed the adjoining subdivisions. This shed no further light on the problem that was rapidly approaching intractable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The problem was so perplexing that I went to the field myself to hunt for more evidence. I pulled the adjoining subdivision maps and decided to tie into those so I could figure out how the subject subdivision was suppose to look like on the ground in theory. When this data was analyzed and assembled a rather startling picture began to emerge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The original Land Surveyor and the Surveyors of the adjoining subdivisions had reputations that were impeccable. I had followed them many times before and there was little doubt that they would have staked the subdivisions exactly the way they were showing it on the subdivision maps. The boundary of the adjoining subdivisions could be located beyond a reasonable doubt. The subject subdivision fit perfectly inside of those boundaries. Using this projection, what appeared to be, original monuments were found marking two of the eight Block corners in the interior of the subdivision in question.</p>\n\n<p>The problem however persisted. Other pieces of evidence set by subsequent retracing Land Surveyors and some of the occupation did not agree with the above solution by as much as 8 feet in a north/south direction. What was more there were yet other pieces of evidence set by subsequent retracing Land Surveyors and some of the occupation that did not agree with the above solution by as much as 10 feet in an east/west direction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The question became why would people owning these Lots in this certain Block have ended up occupying land other than what had been conveyed to them according to the Public Record they purchased their land under?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A careful examination of the subject subdivision map and its relationship with the adjoining subdivision maps offered some clues. The adjoining subdivision map where it intersected the boundary of the subject subdivision had a street width of 40 feet. The subject tract subdivision had a street width of 50 feet. In other words the intent had been to have a 10 foot jog in the street as it widened from 40 to 50 feet. If a Land Surveyor attempting to retrace the boundary of one of the Lots within the subject Block had found the adjoining subdivision\u2019s Block corner and tried to project that street line northerly into the subject subdivision this would account for a 10 foot shift in a north/south direction. The original Block corner must have been destroyed at some early point and careless Land Surveyors who had not looked closely at the subdivision map had created this problem by attempting to locate Lots within the subject Block by using the Block corner from an adjoining subdivision. This still did not resolve the other problem with the evidence and improvements being shifted 8 feet in an east/west direction however.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I made several attempts to locate more evidence within the subject Block until an old pipe was located near the base of this tier of Lots the subject Lot was in. This pipe did not agree with any of the previous solutions by 8 feet in and east/west direction and some of the improvements and subsequent retracing Land Surveyor\u2019s stakes found within this tier of Lots seemed to have been built or staked using it. The fences in this tier of Lots along with some of the subsequent retracing Land Surveyor\u2019s stakes found zig zagged back and forth by up to 8 feet. I headed out to the field once again to take a close up look at all of the evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The close examination of the pipe in question was a shocker. I dug around the pipe deeper and deeper trying to figure out more about the character and nature of it. At about 3 feet deep is when I hit an underground \u201cT\u201d in it. I dug the hole wider but it became apparent that the \u201cevidence\u201d in question was nothing more than a very ancient water spigot connection that somebody had simply left in place. Land Surveyors who had found the pipe had used it to construct the boundaries of the Lots they were retracing contrary to the recorded subdivision map not realizing that the \u201cmonument\u201d they had found was nothing more than garbage never intended to mark any boundary what so ever.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This \u201csimple\u201d survey had ended up costing me ten times what I had bid on it in the first place. I prepared a lengthy Surveyor\u2019s Report explaining all of it and offering various solutions for resolving the problem. I drafted up the final survey and delivered it to my client in person. I spent well over an hour explaining how and why the survey showed what it showed and how the problem could be resolved with little or no money.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The client was very unhappy despite all of my efforts because it showed that what he was occupying was not what he had purchased. He told me to change the survey to match the location of his improvements. I refused explaining the limit of a Land Surveyor\u2019s power and authority and reiterating cheap solutions for resolving the problem. He said he would not pay for the survey because it did not show what he wanted. I told him I would have no choice but to turn him over to a collection agency. He eventually did write a check and I left him still rather upset.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A few days later I learned that he had cancelled the check after he had given it to me. I turned him over to a collection agency and he never paid the bill. More than five years went past before I got another phone call about a Lot in this same tier of Lots the previous survey had been in. This was a women who had been told by her neighbor that some of her improvements were encroaching by as much as 10 feet on to her neighbor\u2019s land. She hired me but it turned out that I agreed with the Land Surveyor next door who apparently had gone through the same mess I had gone through and come to the same conclusions. She was so impressed by the survey map I produced (eve though it was bad news for her) that she told a neighbor about me. They took one look at the map I had produced on her land and hired me to survey their land too. One thing led to another and I was hired by an adjoiner of the original tract of land I had surveyed in the tier of Lots.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The new client and my old client (who never paid me) were locked in a boundary dispute. Lawsuits back and forth had already started and both of them were in possession of surveys which conflicted. My old client had apparently found a Land Surveyor who showed the boundary where he wanted it, unfortunately that survey was substandard. My client filed a compliant with the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying against the Land Surveyor who prepared the survey for my old client which resulted in them getting fined and sanctioned. That Land Surveyor withdrew their survey from evidence. My old client then hired another Land Surveyor who produced yet another survey showing something similar as the other Land Surveyor who had been sanctioned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My client\u2019s lawyer contacted the new Land Surveyor of my old client to obtain an original copy of the survey they had performed on the land in question. When the other Land Surveyor found out the matter was being litigated, the last Land Surveyor had been sanctioned and that I had a survey that showed the boundary differently they altered their survey to match mine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At this point the lawsuit had been dragging on for months with my old client not being able to produce a survey that would hold up better than a wet paper napkin. Since my old client was unwilling or unable to produce a survey on their property the Court ordered a survey of their property be done by my new client.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/7dV4xLLYT7pMdAVPT9sw6OJv6DbsKvSI8L0nU9isiRh6bYLl6clhz*LX7uJAfEyPpRGSAs5np9XAy*7Y0rwkjCTv1GajkgBu/09012013_00000.pdf\" target=\"_self\">09012013_00000.pdf</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This posed a rather interesting ethical dilemma for me. I had already \u201csurveyed\u201d the property in question so how could I charge to \u201csurvey\u201d it again? My old client never paid for the original survey. I had never received permission to release the original survey I had performed on that property from my old client. The improvements had changed since I did the survey on this property some five years earlier. I had revealed to my new client that I had performed a survey of the old client\u2019s property before. The Court knew or should have known that I had surveyed the old client\u2019s property in the past. There actually seemed to be no \u201cdilemma\u201d at all. I went out and surveyed the old client\u2019s land with the police in tow. The old client just glared at us occasionally shouting in our general direction that the boundary we were staking was \u201cwrong\u201d and that he knew where the \u201creal\u201d boundary was. I am expecting this to finally be resolved in the next day or so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am involved in yet another lawsuit that is ongoing with a different person in this same Block some four or five Lots to the north of this problem due to the same occupation/deed location issue as discussed above. These problems could be fixed easily if my clients and their neighbors would listen to me and cooperate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is an old saying \u201cyou can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make them drink.\u201d It seems some of my clients would rather pay a Lawyer tens of thousands of dollars than listen to a Land Surveyor but I have to admit it is hard to blame some of them given this story.<br/> <br/> \u201cCome Ahead!\u201d</p>","createdDate":"2013-09-01T16:46:31.020Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-04T11:11:33.773Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2013-09-01T16:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:238699","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","title":"Chain!","description":"<p>It is human nature to choose a course and then stick with it. Tenacity and staunch conviction are qualities we all admire and\u00a0traditionally seek in those who are leaders in our society. However, professional land surveying is as much of a science as\u00a0it is an art. Evaluating evidence and forming opinions are vital aspects in executing a proper survey.</p>\n<p><br/> Forming an opinion before the facts are known is the definition of a biased opinion and is the death knell for a professional\u00a0surveyor's credibility. In order to be a professional land surveyor one must be willing to change one's opinion as the facts become known. I am reminded of a quote of Curtis Browns\u2018 from his first edition text, Boundary Control &amp; Legal Principles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To William C. Wattles, an authority and dean of title matters, is my dedication for his oft-repeated sage counsel-to most legal principles the statement \"the contrary may be shown\" should be added.</p>\n<p><br/> This painful but true fact must be kept in mind when performing a survey. As a professional land surveyor you must be able to reverse your position if facts become available that would lead to different conclusions. Professional land surveying is not a political endeavor nor is it an exercise of advocacy or ego. Professional land surveying is the art and science of evaluating evidence as the concerned parties and the law would evaluate it. This is what makes our practice a profession. Much to my chagrin I have seen far too many examples of the former mind set in some surveyor's philosophy and practice.</p>\n<p><br/> If you wish to practice as a professional be aware that you must be willing to make exhaustive searches for evidence to the satisfaction that your conclusions can be supported. The risk of coming to a conclusion and giving an opinion is that this will never prevent other evidence and facts from being found and your conclusions rendered irrelevant or untenable. This is simply a function of the science and art that is our profession. The true professional can change their opinion and often do, a politician, advocate or egotist often can't.</p>\n<p><br/> Come ahead!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(This article was originally published by the Gulf Coast Chapter of the Texas Society of Professional Surveyors Journal, July/August 2009).</p>","createdDate":"2013-08-05T12:43:38.400Z","updatedDate":"2016-06-13T16:13:19.265Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2013-08-05T12:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:242444","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"<p>I agree Fred Sission Jr..

He was 113. \"He died peacefully. His family members were with him,\" said Junko Nakao, a city official in Miyakonojo on Japan's southern island of Kyushu. Tanabe died of heart failure, she said. Tanabe, who was born on Sept. 18, 1895, had eight children - five sons and three daughters. The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>former city land surveyor</strong></span> also had 25 grandchildren, 53 great-grandchildren, and six great-great-grandchildren, according to a statement from Miyakonojo city.</p>\n<p>Tomoji Tanabewas certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest man when he was 111 years old. Guinness said Briton Henry Allingham, whose 113th birthday was June 6, is now the world's oldest man. Allingham, one of only two surviving World War I veterans in Britain, lives in a nursing home near Brighton in southern England. Tanabe lived with his fifth son and daughter-in-law. His favorite meals were fried shrimp and Japanese miso soup with clams, the city statement said. Tanabe drank milk every morning and read the newspaper. He also avoided alcohol and did not smoke, it said. The city's mayor, Makoto Nagamine, said Tanabe was \"the symbol of the Miyakonojo known as a city of long life.\" *Material from The Associated Press used in this report*</p>\n<p><object width=\"600\"

But the kid they put on our crew was cocky arrogant and wreck less. Within the third day he was confident, I asked him to start the job on the dc and he lipped, you do it man I already know this pipeline stuff it's easy, you'll be on my crew one day. My PC looked at me and smirked, he said mario, it's all yours. We had a small topo to collect but we couldn't drive it. It was 3800 feet away, so I told the rookie, were going to go do a topo put about 30 lathe in the bag 2 cans of orange paint and the 2lb sledge hammer. As we get there my pc can't stop laughing..the rookie asks what's so funny, he said boy you've been yapping you know everything about pipeline right? He responds yes sir I do, we'll you should know you don't need lathe for topo! Boy that rookie cussed and cried all the way back to the truck. He called in the next day .

As an adult, I realize the value in not receiving outright solutions, but being forced to figure things out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It will never escape me. Even today, when presented with a roadblock while building for the web, I am tempted to get by with the help of the latest grid system, button generator, table maker, or plugin.

When I solely rely on the tools of others, my work is at their mercy, leaving me less creative and resourceful, and, thus, less able to contribute to the advancement of our industry and community. The same exact truth exists in <strong>land surveying</strong>. \u00a0Without a mentor, do you <em>really\u00a0</em>know what you are doing?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things about this community is how generous and collaborative it can be, <em>when we work together</em>. I bet we can all think of a time where being able to implement a shared resource has proved a benefit to our own work and sanity. Because <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/pages\" target=\"_self\">these resources</a>\u00a0are so valuable, it\u2019s important that we continue to be a part of the conversation in order to further develop solutions and ideas. It\u2019s easy to assume there\u2019s someone smarter or more up-to-date in any one area, but with a degree of understanding and perspective, we can all participate. Surveyors can all become better surveyors on this networking community of practice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I love this pattern of collaboration because it involves a fairly specific dialectical process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Initial idea or prototype is outlined or built, then shared</li>\n<li>Discuss</li>\n<li>Someone develops or improves it, then shares it</li>\n<li>Discuss</li>\n<li>Someone else develops or improves it, then shares it.</li>\n<li>Infinity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is what the network looks like when we build it together, and I\u2019d be willing to argue that steps 2+ are absolutely crucial.

I see a day when the lines that delineate surveying and all of the accompanying geospatial sciences will have become so blurred that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another. \u00a0And like Justin, I see a day <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blogs/when-we-are-all-dead\" target=\"_self\">when we are all dead</a>\u00a0and if we do not prepare the future generations by providing a blueprint to our experiences, what they will be doing in their career will have become a splintered version of what we now call ours.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many have asked \"<a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/forum/topics/what-is-happening-to-our\" target=\"_self\">What is Happening to Our Profession?</a>\" and that is a very real and troubling question indeed. \u00a0We have forgotten the basic principles of communication and story telling. \u00a0We have forgotten that their are hundreds of thousands of professionals around the world that do the exact same job as we do because many of us have forgotten that the world does not rotate around our person. \u00a0We are not the axis upon which all things turn. \u00a0In the United States, in particular, there is a breed of \"know it all\" and \"holier than thou\" surveyors who seem to whole-heartedly believe that they drove the original stake. \u00a0These guys are anything but professional. \u00a0They destroy lines of communication. \u00a0They belittle their fellow surveyors for asking questions, yet provide little if any useful anecdote to support their opinion. \u00a0 Every discussion seems to grind to a screeching halt. \u00a0We no longer stop to speak with one another; we just pass each other mumbling. \u00a0<em><strong>Where does this get us?</strong></em> \u00a0To a point of no return.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I realize that I have an opportunity to plant a seed here on LSU in the form of a <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blog/list\" target=\"_self\">story</a>. \u00a0This seed may one day become a tree for someone brilliant to roost their career in. \u00a0We all have this opportunity for the first time in history to help turn on light bulbs that will never burn out. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I have made it my personal quest to help every surveyor who wants to work <a href=\"http://jobs.landsurveyorsunited.com\" target=\"_blank\">find a job</a>, no matter where they live in the world. \u00a0I, of course will never be able to help everyone, but the fact that I try a little bit every single day makes me feel like I am doing my part for this industry. \u00a0Because, <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blogs/happy-4-000-lsu\" target=\"_self\">like Scott Warner</a>, I do what I do without pay and driven purely by passion, I know that I am doing something that will extend much farther than the my own personal reach and will help future generations of land surveyors have the stories that they want to share for the benefit of this profession.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So the next time I sit down at this chair to share an experience, I will look back at this post to remind myself of why I am sharing anything at all. It is because I have footsteps. \u00a0Some of those footsteps have been heavy and others too soft to follow. \u00a0The fact of the matter is that they all count and without both the soft and the hard, there would never be a trail for others to track if they chose to follow my example.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>A few possible topics for my next story (or yours):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Five Most Memorable Mistakes of My Surveying Career</li>\n<li>Top Ten Things I've Learned in the Field that You Can't Learn in School</li>\n<li>My Surveying Mentor and What I Learned from Him/Her</li>\n<li>Why Data in the Field Does't Always Make Good Data in the Office</li>\n<li>Why I Chose to Become a Land Surveyor</li>\n<li>Who NOT to Follow by Example in this Industry</li>\n<li>Historical Surveying Methods I Use Every Single Day</li>\n<li>Why Sometimes It Can Be Better to Get Back to Basics</li>\n<li>My Daily Life as a Party Chief</li>\n<li>The Differences in Duties for a Rodman and an Instrument Man</li>\n<li>5 Gadgets I Take to the Field to Make Work Simpler and More Productive</li>\n<li>5 Classes That I have Taken That Changed My Career</li>\n<li>How NOT to Record Property Lines</li>\n<li>The Pros and Cons of Having Multiple Licenses</li>\n<li>The Day I Discovered I was Doing the Wrong Kind of Surveying</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> No one else on Earth has lived your life, had your experiences, or seen the world through your eyes.

Where the perpetrator (Surveyor) should be able to collect field data, conduct research, analyze and make decisions appropriate to the final target which it is responsible. Also of course Surveyor required to be able to submit their work in the form of either a written Employment Data, digital, and optical, to be used as the basis for determining the other party, and the calculation of a plan or the result of the application of a plan or design in quantity.</p>\n<p><br/>With the support facilities and the ability to both technical and non-technical, it is expected that surveyors can work with the maximum. Technical support and capability it will not be something that can be used if maximum is not supported by a good governance.</p>\n<p><br/>So a good governance is absolutely necessary to organize, Surveyor ability to produce a target. Due to the large scope of the field surveyor jobs, then we will limit the scope of Engineering Surveyors (Surveyor Engineering) were much engaged in civil projects and infrastructure.</p>\n<p><br/>Governance system that we define as SMS (short message instead) but short of Surveying Management Standards.</p>\n<p><br/>In an engineering project needs to be underlined that the task of a surveyor is the applicator design field, in terms of dimensions, (where surveying to know the dimensions of the two derivatives, namely height and position or elevation and coordinates). This is the main task of the surveyor as the guardian of the design dimensions, and accountable at every stage of the work and the end result a piece of work as outlined in the data field lapangan.Data accurate is an implementation of the design in the field that can be used as a barometer of the application design, instead compatible data field is the main capital to estimate the success of a project.</p>\n<p><br/>Determination of Standard Management Surveying on a project should be integrated with the project owner, which must be validated in untukkejelasan accountability because there are things that are technically and administratively.</p>\n<p><br/>Vision begins with digging a project aligned with the idea of \u200b\u200bthe project owner, the determination of Surveying Management Standards can begin. Broadly speaking, corporate governance can be defined as follows:</p>\n<p><br/>1. Personnel and Organizational Structure Determination Surveying Team, and introduced him to the owner of the project and their qualifications as targeted job.</p>\n<p>2. Surveying to determine the position of team organization structure implementation of a project.</p>\n<p>3. Make Surveying Operational Standards (SOS), a reference implementation, technical and administrative.</p>\n<p>4. Determine the values \u200b\u200bof Bench Mark. (X, Y, Z), as the basis for the main reference measurement.</p>\n<p>5. Documentation, Inventory and Distribution Data Work Stages Results, as well as a reference work / working drawings.</p>\n<p>6. Determining patterns of job evaluation.</p>\n<p>7. Improvement of Human Resources.</p>\n<p>8. Increased Personnel Welfare.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A. DETERMINATION OF PERSONNEL</p>\n<p><br/>Specifies the qualified personnel into a target project can not be considered as something easy. Before determining the team members, a requirement that management or personnel will collaborate with Tim Surveying, choose who will be the leader in the team, right perogratif certainly needed here to designate who should be \"Chief Surveyor\" with qualifications, mastering jobs, engineering measurement, survey instruments, until of course, understand and be able to run the governance team and its function. After that, we can discuss with the candidate \"Chiep Surveyor\" to determine the members of the team, a good surveyor, drafter or document processing and its auxiliary field. Selection of personnel timjangan up, ignore the job specification with quality personal, technical, intelligence, or psychological. In Surveying Team ideally be filled with qualified personnel and tasks as follows:</p>\n<p><br/>a. Chief Surveyor:</p>\n<p>Is the coordinator of all team members and responsible, team organization, technical and non-technical skills, intelligence, and self-control negotiations to decide the issue for the benefit of the company. Provide protection to all members of the team, as a whole, to accommodate all the needs of team members both in respect of employment or concerning the needs and welfare of all members of the team personally. Prepare all policies to support the work of the project owner. Melegalitasi field team member's decision in this case and document decisions supporting Surveyor. In prinsifnya Chief Surveyor duty support, and create policies that support the achievement of the course of the project.</p>\n<p><br/>b. Deputy Chief Surveyor:</p>\n<p>Someone who is compatible support their implementation of the Chief Surveyor to be applied in day-to-hari.Dia implementation responsibility to the Chief Surveyor, and report to him the results of periodic jobs, or a Lampiri berkala.Menginventarisasi field data with the image as a reference work.</p>\n<p><br/>c. Surveyor:</p>\n<p>Applicator design with technical and non-technical skills is spearheading the team, even projects. Because each stage of the work must be accounted for in real and dedicated follow and target existing design. As a team member in the front row surveyor should always report the stages of work and the work will start in the form of a validasiya Measurement Data denganpemilik implemented project (Joint Survey) and will be used to base the calculation progress and success of a project in terms of quantity.</p>\n<p><br/>d. Documents and stylists or drafter:</p>\n<p>Is someone with technical ability to manage documents from the field (Measurement Data) and to monitor the validity of a working drawing can be applied dilapangan.Serta document.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>e. Assistant Surveyor:</p>\n<p>Tasks assigned to assist surveyors and surveyors in applying decision lapangan.dengan approval and full control of the surveyor. Assistant surveyor can provide input on the surveyors to resolve the problems in the field.</p>\n<p><br/>f. Helfer:</p>\n<p>Assigned to assist surveyors to mobilize instrumens surveys and other supporting equipment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>B. DETERMINATION OF SURVEYING TEAM POSITION</p>\n<p><br/>To maximize employment and work in a structure Surveying Team Project, it is necessary clarity in the organization structure of the project. It is very important to know the extent to which the function of the team on the field, whether as insfector or as an applicator design.</p>\n<p><br/>The level of team work as an inspector on the results of the field the team deserved to be in the shade of the Department of Quality Control and account for all of the work in this department. This happens usually when teams are at the level of the project owner or prime contractor.</p>\n<p><br/>If the team is dedicated to applying the design directly in the appropriate field team is at the Department of Engineering. And can coordinate with the Department. QC to conduct joint inspections (Joint survey) with the appropriate authorities.</p>\n<p><br/>So the position of the Surveying team in a project management structure is essential to be able to describe the chain of command and accountability work, which in the end were able to work optimally because the team are in the right place and comfortable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br/>C. STANDARD OPERATING SURVEYING (SOS)</p>\n<p><br/>A good team is a team that has the character as the embodiment of the way of working to reach a target. Standardization is needed to create the character in detail which is applied in the field, but it makes it easy to control and identify each type of job.</p>\n<p><br/>Standardization is needed by Surveying Team, as Surveying is a science, technology and raw art, as well as having the rules in its implementation.</p>\n<p><br/>In Standard Operating Surveying (SOS), there are some things that all of synergy, among others.</p>\n<p>a. Measurement Data Format.</p>\n<p>b. Mechanism of Joint Survey.</p>\n<p>c. Determine the level of accuracy.</p>\n<p>d. Determination of the appropriate instrument, certification, calibration and verification.</p>\n<p>e. Treatment Instrument field.</p>\n<p>f. Storage and maintenance of instruments.</p>\n<p>g. Standard equipment support.</p>\n<p>h. Standardization marking (Marking)</p>\n<p>i. The number of personnel in the field survey team.</p>\n<p>j. Work reporting system.</p>\n<p>k. Mobilization Team and Instrument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br/>D. DETERMINING THE VALUE OF BENCH MARK (BM)</p>\n<p><br/>BM values \u200b\u200bare valid and accurate is very important because as a basic reference for deploying the project targets. The validity of the value of BM must be in control periodically, conducted jointly with the project owner. In one project setidaknnya one BM and Control Point (CP), which pairs. From here the next triangle mesh belt can be developed.</p>\n<p><br/>Once the value of BM and CP, completely accurate, it is important an official report was made to validate the values \u200b\u200bof BM and CP tersebut.Bukan only major, but all Temporory Control Point (TCP) are made for the benefit of the field should be reported and tentative diregristasi by Tim Survey.Sehingga every BM, CP and TCP, the error rate can be minimized.</p>\n<p><br/>Before performing the development of these values, should all the teams of contractors and project owners are present to account with these values.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>E. Documentation, Inventory and Distribution Data Work Tahapa Results</p>\n<p><br/>Future Surveyor is a surveyor who is able to present the data, the results of work that can be understood by others, sometimes not only able to present data in surveying rules but should be able to provide analysis that can be used as a reference by the other party in making decisions.</p>\n<p><br/>After surveying the data generated must be used in addition to others, Tim Surveying and Surveyors itself, holding the data, the same well-documented, as is the evidence of the work of surveyors, other forms of accountability in the future if there is something questionable.</p>\n<p><br/>Inventory and distribution of data, the team should be accounted for in writing, because after surveying the data are intellectual property, the surveyor is concerned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br/>F. JOB EVALUATION</p>\n<p><br/>Measuring results in the achievement of quality targets impossible can be done without going through a process. With the implementation of a standardized governance system (SMS), but needs to be monitored the extent to which the accuracy of the implementation. The pattern is absolutely necessary in order to evaluate ongoing and the team members were able to do with the existing rules and be able to work together, and ultimately, a conscious member of the team is able to live up to the rules and finish the target well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br/>G. IMPROVEMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES</p>\n<p><br/>A good team is a team whose members complement each other, and always encourage other members to do something better, the level of awareness among the members of the team were able to create a solid team. In addition each course can transform all its resources. In factual, increased resources should be a priority as a token of appreciation for all members of the team.</p>\n<p><br/>With the increasing technical and non-technical skills will certainly make it easier to achieve team targets large an organization.

I also explore the accuracy of one of his surveys in terms of \u2018following in his footsteps\u2019 when reinstating boundaries created by Wilson almost 150 years ago. <br/>\n<a title=\"View How Good Was He? on Scribd\" href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/109292777/How-Good-Was-He\" style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block; text-decoration: underline;\">How Good Was He?</a><object id=\"doc_54381\" name=\"doc_54381\" height=\"600\" width=\"100%\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf\" style=\"outline:none;\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#ffffff\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"false\"></param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"never\"></param><param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"document_id=109292777&amp;access_key=key-aidf11hj832t9cua7do&amp;page=1&amp;viewMode=scroll\"></param><embed wmode=\"opaque\" id=\"doc_54381\" name=\"doc_54381\" src=\"http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf?document_id=109292777&amp;access_key=key-aidf11hj832t9cua7do&amp;page=1&amp;viewMode=scroll\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"never\" allowfullscreen=\"false\" height=\"600\" width=\"100%\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"></embed> </object>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/jV1sZCFJXnUNPIBmZSMX1x6N3fs4-qoLeDK5Hg-r06b1RtrOf8vYgssUPUOqkvufS1zKykYVqONNtMX3OviHnA__/HowGoodWasHe.pdf\" target=\"_self\">HowGoodWasHe.pdf</a></p>","createdDate":"2012-10-07T22:00:39.284Z","updatedDate":"2016-08-03T23:10:05.679Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2012-10-07T22:00:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:120991","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"<p>Fascinating.\u00a0</p>","createdDate":"2012-10-14T19:34:46.334Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:119986","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"<p>very interesting...i'm downloading it and will read it tonight..thanks for sharing!</p>","createdDate":"2012-10-07T22:42:24.957Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:119767","contributorName":"2hxuf12unefl6","title":"German cadastre","description":"<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">One of the reasons I registered here was that I was interested to see how things are done in other countries. Now I decided in return to write how the cadastral system and cadastral surveys work in Germany, as maybe someone here might find it interesting.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">I didn't know where to start. It's impossible to tell how it works without talking about how it works (even if its theoretical and boring). The reason why it is done this way is based in its history, which, on the other hand, is impractical to talk about without even knowing how it works today.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">So I decided first to</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">I know I'm not an expert; instead from own experience (which I don't have) I can only write from what I heard and read. Also it's difficult to write in a language which isn't my first language. So I can't guarantee that everything I write is correct. But my intention is just to give a short introduction, so I hope what I know and write is sufficiant for this.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">Another thing I have to mention is, that in Germany the cadastre is regulated by state law, and so every state (Germany has 16 states) has it's own regulations and laws. What I write here is based on the cadastre in Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen), but as far as I know it's similar in the other states.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">So what is a cadastre? Wikipedia says:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"><i>A <b>cadastre</b> (also spelled <b>cadaster</b>) [...] is a comprehensive register of the metes-and-bounds real property of a country. A cadastre commonly includes details of the ownership, the tenure, the precise location (some include GPS coordinates), the dimensions (and area), the cultivations if rural, and the value of individual parcels of land.</i></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">In Germany, the cadastre (<i>Kataster</i>) is basically an official register of the boundaries of the land parcels and thus of the properties. It is kept by the cadasre offices. In Lower Saxony these are now departments of the State Office for Geo-Information and Land Development Lower Saxony (<i>Landesamt f\u00fcr Geoinformation und Landentwicklung Niedersachsen</i>, LGLN). In some other states the cadastre offices aren't state offices but organized by the counties and cities.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">The cadastre must not be confused with the land register (<i>Grundbuch</i>, litterally <i>book of land</i>), which registers the ownership of the land (or, as you might say, the title to the land) and also easements and mortgages. The land register is a separate register kept by the local court (<i>Amtsgericht</i>). Originally it was paper based, but it was digitalised a few years ago.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">Normally, every transfer of land ownership must be done with written and notarized contract and isn't valid until registered in the land register.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">So the land register tells you, who owns the land, and the cadastre tells you, where it is.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">Both are updated with each other: The information about the owner of a parcel in the cadastre is updated using the land register, and on the other hand the parcel numbers in the land register are updated using the cadastre. Nowadays this is done electronically, but I former times the offices wrote each other letters.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">You might ask why there are two different registers kept at different offices. The reason for this is that the cadastre originally had the only purpose to register land ownership for fair taxation (as it's still the case in some other European countries) while the land register always had the purpose to secure land ownership, so both had very different purposes. And nowadays merging them wouldn't be easy for various reasons. For example the cadastre is regulated by state law and the land register is regulated by federal law.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">The cadastre itself consists of different parts:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\" lang=\"en-US\" xml:lang=\"en-US\">The part which is the most</p>","createdDate":"2012-10-06T01:28:16.083Z","updatedDate":"2012-10-06T03:10:26.752Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"draft","publishTime":"2012-10-06T01:28:16.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:117752","contributorName":"3ci4753gge739","title":"ProFlex500 RTK base station updated after pecan tree removal","description":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\" class=\"font-size-3\">It seems reasonable to think that removing the huge pecan tree east of the ProFlex500 base station antenna would influence the OPUS results. \u00a0But my first OPUS report following removal of the tree was included in the current average NAD83(2011) position. \u00a0This remains a work in progress. \u00a0Over time there will be more OPUS sessions. \u00a0Each time I will decide whether to include it in the average or begin again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\" class=\"font-size-3\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\" class=\"font-size-3\">The OPUS reports, raw data files, and more photos are available on my projects ftp site.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\" class=\"font-size-3\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\" class=\"font-size-3\">The ProFlex500 can be viewed at <a href=\"http://72.215.9.254\">http://72.215.9.254</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\" class=\"font-size-3\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\" class=\"font-size-3\">Here are some before and after photos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\" class=\"font-size-3\"><a href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/wOHap2BTlmeB8JuXgkin-o7mthmqvoLG-Q0V7OWuP3MXM6bo9kTga0-IIrI6NmT8Hwl09wNQ451*DGo52oWm8g__/100_5950.JPG\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/wOHap2BTlmeB8JuXgkin-o7mthmqvoLG-Q0V7OWuP3MXM6bo9kTga0-IIrI6NmT8Hwl09wNQ451*DGo52oWm8g__/100_5950.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\" class=\"align-full\"/></a>With the pecan tree removed the skyline looks much different.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\" class=\"font-size-3\"><a href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/R--EI79dJLjHfcCLmixSnqLKuLOLhjKg*j9I8ns6IFWuiXXj6HNHtFd5WqgUbenfJQxfOXd9u4VPB47jMRD4TQ__/100_6010.JPG\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/R--EI79dJLjHfcCLmixSnqLKuLOLhjKg*j9I8ns6IFWuiXXj6HNHtFd5WqgUbenfJQxfOXd9u4VPB47jMRD4TQ__/100_6010.JPG?width=750\" width=\"750\" class=\"align-full\"/></a></span></p>\n<p></p>","createdDate":"2012-09-24T06:13:02.341Z","updatedDate":"2014-12-03T14:22:53.548Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2012-09-24T06:13:02.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:115538","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","title":"A Real Land Survey","description":"<p><a href=\"http://danceswithfat.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/truth.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://danceswithfat.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/truth.gif\" alt=\"a real land survey\" class=\"align-full\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>My client has authorized the release of this material to any interested parties.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an actual situation which I see on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The client contacted me wanting a survey performed on his property.

This client typically purchased commercial properties and then reconditioned them into a profitable businesses. He would then either sell them or retain them depending on the revenue stream and capital gain. We had been able to save him from making bad decisions previously on real property transactions so we were the first he called.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We negotiated a price and contract and once the contract was executed we went to work. The subject tract did not appear to be much of a challenge. It was a couple of Lots in a recorded subdivision from the 1940s. It was odd couple of Lots however. The two Lots formed a Block that took the shape of a right triangle according to the recorded subdivision map. The Block was bounded by streets on all sides, two of which were major traffic arteries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hcad.org/iMaps/Tiles/Color/5155D5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">View Lot</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We made a brief search of the Public records to prepare ourselves for the first field visit to the site. An interesting set of circumstances began to arise from this initial research. The Digital Tax Map showed the site as being configured differently than a right triangle. The configuration shown on the Digital Tax Map increased the area of the site by more than two fold and looked something like Jimmy Durante\u2019s nose. An Affidavit of Ownership and Possession (AOP) was found in the Public Records filed in 1982 by the current owner of the site with a description attached which appeared to be very similar to the configuration the Digital Tax Map was showing. The vesting Deed executed in 1978 into the current owner was only for the two Lots. A partial chain of title was assembled to search for possible abandonments of the street areas the Digital Tax Map and AOP description appeared to encompass but nothing else was found other than the description for the two Lots.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We made an first visit to the site armed with this information but little evidence was found as far as monuments on the ground. All the improvements were located and the data was brought back to the office to be analyzed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the meantime the Title Commitment for the site was forwarded to us from our client and we were surprised when we found that it listed the description of the site from the AOP filed in 1982. There was no mention in the Title Commitment of a possible street abandonment by the City or even the vesting Deed. We hired a professional Abstractor who searched the Public Records but found no instrument abandoning any part of the streets. The recorded subdivision map showed the southerly adjoining street width at 250 feet wide in the area where the AOP description encroached the most into it. It encroached as much as 45 feet into that street right of way in some cases. The AOP description also encroached a couple of feet into the northern adjoining street which had recorded width of 100 feet. The AOP description did not encroach on the easterly adjoining street but instead clipped the street intersections (cutback) from the recorded subdivision map description. No evidence of this additional street dedication was found in the public records other than in the AOP.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>From the field data it became apparent that the description filed in the AOP fit an area all the way to the edge of the curb on the new large streets that had been built. These streets had been rebuilt around 1980. The southerly adjoining street once has been laid out boulevard style and had a large park in the middle of the street right-of-way where a trolly had ran. It had one way streets on either side right up against the edge of the street right-of-way. When it was rebuilt around 1980 they placed the new streets much closer to the center of the right-of-way and the trolly had long ago ceased running. All the old street paving had been removed with the exception of a section of pavement directly adjoining the site to the south. It appeared as if the owner of the site had been using the old street pavement as a parking lot, even going as far as to paint parking spaces on it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We prepared for our second visit to the site. The configuration of the existing buildings on the site suggested they would exactly fit the vesting Deed which described only two Lots. A projection was computed, based on the building locations on the site, to other Block corners within the subdivision to see if we could find some supporting monuments for the vesting Deed description and recorded subdivision map.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When visited the site and a number of physical monuments were found in the adjoining Blocks closely agreeing with the theory that the limits of the existing buildings on the site were the boundary of the two Lots. The corners on the site where then staked and a survey was issued to our client along with a Surveyor\u2019s Report explaining what we had found.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter we began receiving phone calls from people at the Title Insurance Company insisting the survey we produced was incorrect. We also received a phone call from the current owner of the site who also expressed the opinion that the survey we produced was wrong. We explained what we had found to each person who called. However this seemed to do little toward changing their opinions of our work. Next our client called and then dropped by the office where we showed him copies of the documents and research we had obtained in the course of performing the survey of the site. We warned the client that if they purchased the site they would only be purchasing what our survey had on it, not what was on the Digital Tax Map or in the Title Commitment. The client left saying he was going to pass on purchasing the site.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Several months went by and we received a phone call from a local Lawyer who was calling on behalf of his client. The Lawyer was interested in getting a survey performed on the same site mentioned above. He was also interested in a possible Affidavit of Merit depending on the results of the survey so that he could include another Land Surveyor who had surveyed the site in a lawsuit he was preparing for his client. I informed the Lawyer that I had previously surveyed the site and that I was compelled to contact my previous client and seek their permission before I could release any material on it. Further I told the Lawyer I could not speak with him about this particular site until I had spoken with my previous client about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later that day we received written permission from our previous client to engage with the Lawyer. I called the Lawyer back and gave him a brief rundown of what we knew about the site. He stated that his client has purchased the site and was now suing the Title Insurance Company, the Land Surveyor and the seller involved in the transaction. The Lawyer\u2019s client had attempted to get a building permit from the City to develop the \u201cparking lot\u201d adjoining the south side of the site and was informed he did not own it. I negotiated and executed a contract with the Lawyer, then sent him a package of the existing material we had on the site.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A couple of days went by and I received a package from the Lawyer. The package contained a copy of a survey performed after the survey we had performed by another Land Surveyor that showed a boundary that matched the Title Commitment description, Digital Tax Map configuration and the AOP description. There were also documents to the effect that the Title Insurance Company had hired this other Land Surveyor to do the survey for the transaction on the site. The \u201ccontract\u201d between the Title Insurance Company and the Land Surveyor was nothing more than a work order with the express conditions that the survey would be \u201cpaid at closing\u201d, would be \u201cperformed within 3 days\u201d and would be \u201cpaid only if approved by the Title Insurance Company.\u201d They were the \u201cPreferred Land Surveyor\u201d of this Title Insurance Company.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An Affidavit of Merit was prepared and delivered to the Lawyer. We talked to the Lawyer several times over the next couple of weeks advising him on various matters relating to his client\u2019s legal action. Several months went by and we got a phone call from the Lawyer saying he was calling us on behalf of his client. The Lawyer said his client wished to thank us for all of our help and that his client was very pleased with our service. The Lawyer also stated that he would not have been able to resolve this situation favorably for his client if it had not been for our help.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since then we have taken several orders from both the Lawyer and his client on various other properties they needed Land Surveys on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Land Surveying is much more than a business, it is a profession.

In this context it must have a width .It can not be invisible but we know you can not measure it, It equals zero from both sides.Like Mr Cavell said, If you have to locate this line you still +/- margin of error. So when you mark it you are saying this is where it is, and this line is visible for everyone to see.So now you have a property line that can be seen. Take this example I did a survey on a Liquor store were it was built on a wet and dry county line. The store was first built and no one was aware of the wet and dry line . I was not involved with this.\u00a0 My survey was to mark the wet and dry line,if the building was out or in the wet side, because no one knew where this line fell.\u00a0 The line fell in the middle of the store. So now you have one half of the store wet the other dry. Simple solution, a line on the floor marking the wet and dry county's one side could sell liquor the other could not.The store was not split, only a line on the floor.In this case the property line was representative of\u00a0 a line mark on the floor 3 inches wide for everyone to see.In a surveyors world the line has no width. but sometimes it has to be showed with one, to the intent of dividing or separating\u00a0 visibly with a width.This case went to court. and this line separates the store.</p>","createdDate":"2016-04-05T18:10:09.205Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:328796","contributorName":"0t9fx79qrbn92","description":"<p>It has no width.\u00a0 It is an abstract line;</p>","createdDate":"2016-04-05T17:49:11.732Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:328736","contributorName":"1ew5utu64gb0o","description":"<p>SIMPLY....

I enjoy our correspondence, too, and it's great to have here a platform for this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But I have to ask when you say: \"Make the base of the rock cliff the boundary and merely reference it with a +/- relationship to placed survey monuments.\" I understand that a mathematical description is not\u00a0necessary to find such a boundary as long as the natural monument is still in place. And a cliff for example is much more durable than a survey monument so it wouldn\u2019t be suddenly gone one day. But how would you show such a boundary on a plat or map? And how would you calculate the area of a parcel with such a boundary as it can\u2019t be described mathematically?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As far as I know (and I know my knowledge is still very limited) such a boundary wouldn\u2019t be possible here. But the law here in Germany is as far as I know very different to the law in the US, and even in Germany there are no uniform laws for surveying. (But interestingly the basic problems of surveying seem to be the same everywhere in the world.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But on the other hand we do have \u201cwater boundaries\u201d, which are defined by the mean water level of a body of water, i. e. a river or stream (which are natural monuments, too, I guess). But even these are approximated by line segments when surveyed as far as I know and recorded as such. This probably makes sense, as the mean water level isn\u2019t always visible when the water level is changing during the year. (Another problem is, that rivers sometimes (and sometimes not, it doesn\u2019t seem to be easy) change their beds through things like erosion, and sometimes the boundary moves with it, making everything complicated. This is one of the things I believed to be impossible, as I thought boundaries couldn\u2019t move, but obviously they can.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also know in former times natural monuments where important, and no-one cared if boundaries where straight lines, as it was enough to know: \u201cI own all the land from this rock to this ditch.\u201d But when the original surveys where performed (around 1875 in this area), these old boundaries where approximated with line segments. (To be fair, it wouldn\u2019t have made much difference, as the approximation was good enough for the precision possible with the toolst hey had (chains and probably theodolites for their traverses). And the surveys where performed in a cheap and quick way, as the reason was to create tax maps; no-one could know that almost 50 years later a court would rule that these records would be legally binding for the land owners.)</p>\n<p>Nowadays most property lines are straight, and when you see a boundary described by short line segments, it\u2019s almost sure it\u2019s a very boundary recorded during the original surveys (and maybe even existing since the Middle Ages). So even if boundaries described by natural monuments where possible, I think they wouldn\u2019t play an important role any more (with exception of the water boundaries of cause).</p>","createdDate":"2012-09-07T17:26:34.468Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:114739","contributorName":"3i7uq8ojnbaej","description":"<p>Tim, your assessment rings true that land surveying is more an art than an exact science.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You said \"But even if we had an exact line we wouldn't have a exact definition of this line, as it wouldn't be a geometrically describable line as a straight line or a circular arc.

And so on ...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By m<span dir=\"auto\">athematical induction we could proof now, that every piece of land would be part of a property line. So either all land owners own every piece of land together, or no-one owns any land. Both is obviously wrong. (Or else there would be no need for surveyors.)</span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"auto\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"auto\">So a property line must have no width, option (1) is correct.<br/></span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"auto\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"auto\">Of cause you can't determine the <span dir=\"auto\">absolutely exact</span> <strong>position</strong> of the line, but that won't give the line a width.<br/></span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"auto\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"auto\">Also, I don't think (3) can be correct. I know neighbors can agree over the position of their property line if it can't be determined by a survey, but I never heard they could agree about the width of the line. Also the <a href=\"http://www.nds-voris.de/jportal/docs/anlage/VVND/pdf/VVND-211600-MI-20050803-SF-A010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">form for a boundary line agreement</a>, published by the Lower Saxony Ministry of the Interior and Sports as appendix 10 of the administrative regulations for real estate surveys doesn't provide a space for the with of the property lines. (Unfortunately it's in German only, but you can believe me there is no such space.) So probably there is no need for such an agreement as lines don't have a width.<br/></span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"auto\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"auto\">Also, option (3) doesn't sound realistic, as this would mean property lines would become quite wide if bigger monuments such as stones are used. Also, we have different symbols for stones, where the center of the stone marks the line, and stones, where the edge of the stone marks the line. (You can see them on the bottom of the second page of the form linked above, directly under the headline \"3 Grenzmarken und Grenzpunkte\" (boundary markers and boundary points).) This would be pointless, if the line had the same with as the stone.<br/></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So in my opinion the only correct option could be (1).</p>","createdDate":"2012-08-30T01:30:52.483Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:114083","contributorName":"3i7uq8ojnbaej","description":"<p>ePalmetto, I was thinking that there ought to be a defined width within the capabilities of modern surveying equipment.\u00a0 If the precision of a particular piece of equipment is 0.01 feet, then wouldn't the line be at least that wide?\u00a0 Of course, I am joking.\u00a0 So how wide were property lines when the precision of the equipment consisted of a theodolite and a steel tape?\u00a0 It must have been wider then than now.\u00a0 Of course, I am joking.\u00a0 So what color is the line?\u00a0 No, I am not crazy, you will see the point of the whole thing by the end of this.</p>","createdDate":"2012-08-30T00:43:43.056Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:113973","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","description":"<p>number six.\u00a0 how wide is wide?</p>","createdDate":"2012-08-29T05:56:47.618Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:113410","contributorName":"3i7uq8ojnbaej","description":"<p>Karl, I am also looking forward to what is posted.\u00a0 In Euclidean geometry, a point is a finite in it's position.\u00a0 Two points of definition, within a void of finite, infinite, and subjective experiment, when connected by a line would logically tend to remain finite and singular.\u00a0 However, think about the last time an attorney had continuing education credits in matters of science - unless they are defending science as a broad stroke in the pool of ambiguity, where the water is murky; opaque at best.</p>","createdDate":"2012-08-26T23:40:58.632Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:113583","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","title":"The sickness that has been allowed to pervade even the Land Surveying profession","description":"<h2>A Problem in the Land Surveying Profession</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/dewardkb/posts/272664382841981?notif_t=share_reply\">http://www.facebook.com/dewardkb/posts/272664382841981?notif_t=share_reply</a>\u00a0Here is something I wanted to point out about a certain sickness that has swept through our Profession (if not the entire American society) over the course of the last 10 years or so.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/IoFtEYk87YjGDSHUctfESCJuuMKWdY7eu3fn3n2kZmgQq8-rSO*uZ8vgQtMtBREuZz*XhGi9P2rocDqvZ27v*w__/angrymanscreaming.jpg\"><img class=\"align-right\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/IoFtEYk87YjGDSHUctfESCJuuMKWdY7eu3fn3n2kZmgQq8-rSO*uZ8vgQtMtBREuZz*XhGi9P2rocDqvZ27v*w__/angrymanscreaming.jpg\" width=\"252\"/></a>I am embarrassed for our profession but unfortunately nothing I say or do seems to have any effect on it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons that I enjoy Land Surveyors United so much.

Every single day that I wake up on this earth, I am greeted by passionate and driven land surveyors from virtually every location on earth, sharing their experiences and finding solutions to their problems on the network. \u00a0Together with <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profile/ScottWarner\" target=\"_self\">RLS Scott Warner of Wisconsin</a>, a set of dedicated calendar days have been determined which will forever serve as a time of annual celebration for geospatial professionals everywhere. \u00a0This week of time will forever be called <strong>International Surveyors Week</strong> and it is happening right this minute. \u00a0On Wednesday the 20th of June, we will be observing the world's first ever, <strong>Survey Earth in a Day</strong> and on the following day (21st) our <strong>Land Surveyors University Project</strong> will relaunch. <strong>\u00a0Land Surveyors University</strong> will be ongoing for 363 days, ending on June 19th 2013. \u00a0This means you will have an entire year to share your experiences and expertise in surveying with your community in <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/land-surveyors-university#tab2\" target=\"_self\">the form of 10 levels of experience</a>, so as to educate those with less experience in the industry through teaching by example. \u00a0These events and activities have been designed to strengthen the alliance of surveyors in all parts of the world and strengthen the body of professionals in the geospatial industry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Background of International Surveyors Week</h3>\n<p><strong>National Surveyors Week,\u00a0</strong>which occurs<strong>\u00a0</strong>in the United States on March 18th-24th, is a time when surveyors around the country get together to celebrate being a part of one of the oldest professions known to man. \u00a0This is a great time for\u00a0camaraderie, <em>but only in the USA</em>. \u00a0This same type of holiday is desperately needed in many other parts of the world, as surveyors have little, if any, proper representation and no professional society to speak of. \u00a0These professionals needed a way to enjoy all of the networking\u00a0privileges\u00a0and notoriety\u00a0as other professionals in more developed areas of the world, so we have created such a way. \u00a0On <strong>Land Surveyors United</strong>, everyone's voice is equally important and equally heard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>You all are surveyors of the world- a world in which everything is interconnected and mutually dependent and interdependent. \u00a0If we aspire to attain the accuracy and precision that our profession demands, we must not forget that you can not separate an organism from its background. \u00a0I hope that well all take a moment out of this week to learn something new and to reach out to a fellow surveyor who has a question that you know the answer to. I hope that you will take the time to enjoy learning how a fellow surveyor accomplishes a similar job as you are familiar with on the other side of the planet. \u00a0This first annual International Surveyors Week is a time for change. \u00a0Be a part of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>International Surveyors Week\u00a0</strong>is a time to celebrate our differences as well as those similarities which make us all understand one another, despite linguistic and cultural differences. \u00a0We all experience learning curves and technological breakdowns. \u00a0We all have trouble at times with learning something new. \u00a0And we all are accountable for the professional decisions that we make. Most other places online built for surveyors are built purely for advertising and pushing the agenda of those who are manufacturing the latest equipment and in those same places you find surveyors bashing other surveyors, simply for asking a question. I have always found it difficult to digest and did something about it. \u00a0In fact, I wake up everyday and do a little something to help this situation become better for you, not for myself. \u00a0Its anthropology which drives me to constantly imagine and create these avenues for all geospatial professionals around the world. \u00a0Take it or leave it, its working! \u00a0And with well over 3000 professionals on this network, many have said that LSU may just be the only qualified community to hold such an event as <strong>International Surveyors Week</strong>. \u00a0 <em>Why?</em> \u00a0Because LSU is the opposite of everything else out there who would love to be like it. \u00a0You are the change that is needed in your industry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Technology Schmechnology</h3>\n<p>With all of the overwhelming advances in survey technology and uncertain futures for geospatial professionals in many parts of the world, what a surveyor needs most is a personal network of other surveyors to lean on in times of need. What separates us all is simply geography. \u00a0You are all the most qualified individuals on earth to understand that. \u00a0When you take that away for just a second, you see that we all are responsible for the same types of results in our work and we must all deal with technological advances which may or may not jeopardize our jobs in the future. \u00a0Working together, this possibility becomes less of a threat. \u00a0As long as we all stick together and share what we know, it will be quite difficult to replace us with robots in the future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just look at our <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/page/global-surveyors-member-map-presentation\" target=\"_self\">Global Member Map Presentation</a>\u00a0to see all of this at work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For those of you who have not yet <a href=\"http://jotformpro.com/form/21137708434956\" target=\"_blank\">registered to participate</a>\u00a0in <a href=\"http://surveyearth.com\" target=\"_blank\">Survey Earth in a Day</a>, you are simply letting your fellow surveyors down. \u00a0You can accomplish the task in minutes, right from where you are working.

The lure of the land caused him to immigrate to Texas in 1833. In 1835 he presented himself to Jorge Antonio Nixon; who had become a citizen of Mexico and was appointed land commissioner in East Texas, requesting the land grant that he was entitled to as a colonist. In picking out his land, he split his certificate placing part in Jefferson County southeast of the ravine of Tevis because of the \u201cmineral water\u201d there, which happened to be the remaining land on <tt>what would later be some of the most valuable land in Texas-acreage at</tt> <tt>Sour</tt> <tt>Lake</tt> <tt>and Spindletop oilfields</tt>. \u00a0Coincidence? I think not!

The reputation of your firm was riding on your ability to fulfill the obligations of the verbal agreements you made with your clients. The quality of your service and product were judged by your ability to stand by the verbal contracts you made.</p>\n<p>Those days are long past as society has become increasingly complex and increasingly litigious. I will be primarily writing about Texas but generally there have been recent attempts at tort reform across the country that have led to a number of changes in codified law which in turn have generated case law. One of the ways to defend against alleged negligence, error or omission on the part of the Land Surveyor is by using contract law. There is an absolute necessity in using a written contract for any agreement to perform a Land Survey in the current environment we find ourselves in. Further such a contract should be structured in a way that manages liability in a prudent manner. This protects both the Land Surveyor and the Public. This also helps inform the Public about what a Land Surveyor is and what a Land Survey is.</p>\n<p>Privity of Contract has been used to defend against alleged negligence, error or omission on the part of the Land Surveyor. The Land Surveyor should address\u00a0the contract and the product to only specific parties.\u00a0This can help limit liability to only specific parties in the contract. If someone claims negligence, error or omission, who is not a party to the contract, their action is generally limited to others. Texas courts have long held that the Economic Loss Rule bars claims for economic damages, when there is no accompanying claim for personal injury and/or property damages. It is difficult to prove personal injury or property damage resulting from a Land Survey, particularly if you are a third party.</p>\n<p>This type of legal theory can be countered with an argument based on the \u201cDeceptive Trade Practices Act\u201d and/or the \u201cSecond Restatement of Torts\u201d but Privity of Contract places a heavy burden on a third party plaintiff. Negligence, error or omission can only violate a contractual duty but if it causes damage beyond the contract this can be problematic for the Land Surveyor. It has been held by the Court that professionals have a legal duty outside the contract not to damage the public. Losses of a pecuniary nature have been held to be indistinguishable from economic losses. Texas case law is still evolving on this issue so stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Incorporating particular requirements for the service and product in a contract can be useful in combating claims centering around what the product should include, what form the deliverables should take and even how the product should be delivered. Using a provision that states a particular \u201cmanual of practice\u201d or a specific set of specifications will be followed to produce the Land Survey is extremely helpful in countering claims of negligence, error or omission.</p>\n<p>Not only professional liability but matters of general liability can be addressed through written contract. An example would be to add a provision to the contract that states \u201cTree limbs, bushes and leaves may be cut in the course of performing the survey, Land Surveyor assumes no liability for resulting damage.\u201d Not only does this reduce liability but it discloses to the client what to expect to happen in the course of the Land Survey being executed.</p>\n<p>It is important to understand that provisions of a contract that violate law are unenforceable and null. For example adding a provision to a contract to perform a Land Survey that violates the Texas Administrative Code has no effect on the contract. Such a provision does not prevent claims of negligence, error or omission by other parties as a result of violating the Texas Administrative Code in the course of fulfilling that specific provision of the contract.</p>\n<p>It may surprise you to know that certain provisions of a contract limiting the liability to the amount of the fee of a Land Survey have been upheld. The Courts are extremely liberal when it comes to upholding what the contract can stipulate. However the appearance of offering only an \u201cAdhesion Contract\u201d must be avoided. Disclosure and providing opportunity to\u00a0negotiate\u00a0are necessary to make a contract enforceable. A simple blank box on the contract with the heading \u201cClients Additional Instructions\u201d for the potential client to fill in when they agree to it and a line in the contract that states the terms and conditions of contract are negotiable before it is executed helps combat this type claim.</p>\n<p>Specific disclaimers in a contract can reduce the potential for claims of negligence, error or omission. For example a provision can be added to the contract stating the Land Surveyor is not responsible for approval or submission of the product to third parties. This avoids later claims by third parties that the product is negligent, in error or contains omissions. If the product meets the specific standard spelled out in the contract (and meets the State codified minimum standard) then the third party has no claim. This also helps combat claims by third parties before they ever occur because the third parties are not privy to the terms of the contract and therefore have no basis to judge the Land Surveyor\u2019s product (beyond the State codified minimum standards).</p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>\n<p>Readings:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wahly.com/rpls/CookConsultants4thCase.pdf\">http://wahly.com/rpls/CookConsultants4thCase.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20AZCO%2020081103041.xml\">http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20AZCO%2020081103041.xml</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/ebriefs/09/09022323.pdf\">http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/ebriefs/09/09022323.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/ebriefs/09/09022311.pdf\">http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/ebriefs/09/09022311.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cbylaw.com/filebin/files/cokinos/gmc-economic_loss.pdf\">http://www.cbylaw.com/filebin/files/cokinos/gmc-economic_loss.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.krcl.net/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;ref=Litigation-Alert%202011%200602\">http://www.krcl.net/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;ref=Litigation-Alert%202011%200602</a></p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>\n<p>Come ahead!</p>","createdDate":"2012-03-24T15:38:03.595Z","updatedDate":"2016-08-15T19:32:14.718Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2012-03-24T15:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:97514","contributorName":"3i7uq8ojnbaej","description":"<p>Deward, as usual, we are on the same page.\u00a0 Keep it coming!</p>","createdDate":"2012-04-02T23:51:05.034Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:97311","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"<p>I am flattered by your comments Scott.</p>\n<p>It is often easy to think this type of thing does not matter and may cost you clients but the reality is if a potential client will not review and sign a written contract then that is a client you do not need.</p>\n<p>The sign of a good business and a good professional is a good contract.

I have sought to engage Land Surveyors across the world in order to deepen my understanding of what constitutes good practice and good principle. The theory behind Land Surveying always was my focus.</p>\n<p>I joined and posted to websites that I thought were dedicated to the purposes I mentioned above. I was very active at some of these sites and participated in many debates dealing with the business and practice of Land Surveying. The added benefit of the information exchange and the varied\u00a0critique made these websites a favorite for me. I am a better Land Surveyor and businessman for it.</p>\n<p>The websites I was posting to were copying the structure, content and look of Land Surveyors United. Eventually I was forced out of these other websites by the people who were operating them.\u00a0Generally I was booted because my view was not the same as their own. When I voiced objections to their actions they deleted me.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Many of the features of Land Surveyors United have been copied by these other competing websites I have mentioned.</strong> In fact these competing websites have been relentlessly lifting the ideas for changes in their own venue from Land Surveyors United.</p>\n<p>As a Land Surveyor I view the practice of copying other peoples work and not crediting them for it as the worst kind of theft. What is more it is simply fraud and I personally will not be associated with that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am invested in as many opinions and as many ideas as I can find, even if I do not agree with them or find them lacking but I will not tolerate this type of behavior. The websites competing with Land Surveyors United are not interested in opinions that make them look bad and thus they will censor you if you question them. Further, they are of apparently such weak character they feel compelled to\u00a0plagiarize.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am glad there is a site like Land Surveyors United, a site so good the \"character\u00a0challenged\"\u00a0are trying to copy it.</p>\n<p></p>","createdDate":"2012-03-08T03:49:35.901Z","updatedDate":"2016-02-13T18:04:21.379Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2012-03-08T03:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:319084","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","description":"<p>3 major things wrong with that site.</p>\n<p>1) \u00a0Whoever runs it must think surveyors are clueless when they post lies like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/9OeEfGTiwaeYBauFfoTd5IqQ2u5qJYRb7d4drDVq3DPjUC4BulZP3rDejcYsvox*zp98HKQ2MHCf7w3jNooMEvmXwiSVs4BE/lies.png\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/9OeEfGTiwaeYBauFfoTd5IqQ2u5qJYRb7d4drDVq3DPjUC4BulZP3rDejcYsvox*zp98HKQ2MHCf7w3jNooMEvmXwiSVs4BE/lies.png\" width=\"434\" class=\"align-full\"/></a></p>\n<p>Think about it... if they got over 1000 new members every 30 days wouldn't they have like a million members?</p>\n<p>2) what kind of person would run a site which gets paid from ads and asks for donations from their members?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) practically every feature of that site is a watered down version of this site. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why can't we just all work together towards the same end?</p>","createdDate":"2016-02-13T17:51:57.936Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:179341","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"<p>It has been close to 2 years since I allowed myself to get heated about this, but something has got to give. \u00a0</p>\n<p>I suppose this will just serve as the discussion where we track the latest attempts by those who consider LSU to be \"competition\", yet repurpose ideas from my mind to push their own agenda..</p>\n<p>Let's see.. just today, I saw that the NSPS has sent yet another letter to the president asking him to endorse.. get this <em>\"Worldwide Surveyors Day\"</em>.. wonder where that Idea came from...<em>hmmm</em></p>\n<p><strong>The new buzz terms for the industry elite:</strong></p>\n<p>Unity, United, Unify</p>\n<p>Global, Globally</p>\n<p>International, Worldwide</p>\n<p>Social</p>\n<p><em>None of these terms seemed to factor in to big market agenda's prior to 2010</em></p>\n<p>I suppose only the elite can write letters to the president and then send out news about it. \u00a0Not once but <em>Twice</em> in the past two months. \u00a0Can anyone remember any other time in the history of the NSPS when there was ever an initiative to collaborate internationally?

I am not surprised that this issue continues to arise.</p>\n<p>We continue to see tests of the Texas Civil Practices and\u00a0Remedies\u00a0Code due to changes that were a result of the recent tort reform. Case law in the particular area of Certificates of Merit has been evolving and despite some early questionable statements by the Court (see my previous article) it seems to have reached a certain maturity.</p>\n<p>In the instant case \"<a href=\"http://www.morelaw.com/verdicts/case.asp?n=01-11-00586-CV&amp;s=TX&amp;d=52114\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph G. Gartrell, Jr. v. Ernest Joseph Wren</a><span>\" the Appellant\u00a0challenged the Certificate of Merit by RPLS Trusky on the grounds that \"<span>the certificate of merit was insufficiently specific\u00a0<span>as to the alleged error regarding</span>\u00a0the area of the real property, the location of the house, and the description of easements\", \"<span>it lacked specificity because it did not state a standard of care\" and that \"<span>Trusky was not an appropriate third party affiant\".</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>These types of legal theory have proven to hold no water in the past although as I mentioned it has led to some confused statements coming from the Court. Unfortunately this confusion has led to attempts (like those in the instant case) to rely on those statements to try and push an\u00a0envelope that simply does not exist.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span>First let's look at the \"third-party argument. Some back ground on the \"third-party\" requirement: \"Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 150.002(a). The certificate of merit is an affidavit of a third-party licensed professional who is competent to testify and holds the same professional license or registration as the defendant, and who is knowledgeable in the area of practice of the defendant.\" In the instant case the Court rightly concludes that the definition of a \"third-party\" is\u00a0<span>\u00a0\u201c[a] person who is not a party to a lawsuit, agreement or other transaction but who is usually somehow implicated in it; someone other than the principal parties.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1617 (9th ed. 2009).\" Trusky is not a party to the lawsuit therefore such an argument is preposterous on it's face.</span></span></p>\n<p>The argument that Trusky's Certificate of Merit \"lacked\u00a0sufficient\u00a0specificity as to a violation of a standard of care\"\u00a0fails to understand the fact that\u00a0<span>the statute does not expressly require the affiant to state the applicable \"standard of care\" as part of the factual basis for the professional\u2019s alleged error. What it states is \"<a href=\"http://law.onecle.com/texas/civil/150.002.00.html\" target=\"_blank\">affidavit shall set forth specifically at least one negligent act, error, or omission claimed to exist and the factual basis for each such claim.</a><span>\" So there is no such requirement for a statement by the Affiant of a violation of a particular \"standard of care.\" The plain words of the statute mean the Certificate of Merit may be for a claim of \"negligence\", \"error\" or \"omission\" and must contain a \"factual basis\" for each such claim.\u00a0</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Finally, we have the argument that Trusky's Certificate of Merit\u00a0\"was insufficiently specific\u00a0as to the alleged error regarding\u00a0the area of the real property, the location of the house, and the description of easements.\" This argument seems to center around the the wording in the statute that requires \"a factual basis for each such claim.\" The statute is requiring the Affiant to provide a reason to believe there is a factual basis for a claim, not that absolute proof must be provided by an Affiant for a factual basis of a claim. That would be determined by the Court or a jury in the course of a trial, not by the Affiant. The Court concludes \"<span>Trusky testified by affidavit that he had \u201cwalked the subject property and [had] prepared a survey of [his] own on the subject property.\u201d We hold that this statement provided the required \u201cfactual basis\u201d for his statements identifying Gartrell\u2019s alleged errors.\"\u00a0</span></span></span></p>\n<p>Here is a link to my <a href=\"http://tsps.org/sites/tsps.org/files/www/chapters/09/MarchApril10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">previous article</a>\u00a0on this subject under the heading \"Chain.\" I suggest that if you are practicing Land Surveying in Texas that you become intimately familiar with this aspect of the law.</p>\n<p><span><span>\u00a0</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></span></p>","createdDate":"2012-02-17T19:39:21.833Z","updatedDate":"2018-12-25T05:27:20.169Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2012-02-17T19:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:88673","contributorName":"24x7kg5f7afwq","title":"Surveying prices in this bad economy.","description":"<p>Let me first say I have been in business for 22 years, during this time I have seen and been through alot.

These men and women have come to trust and depend on me and the cost of a job never comes up, they simply call on me to do the work knowing I will be fair. The new customers and work I am receiving is coming from word of mouth\u00a0recommendation. I have bid jobs over the past two years, and\u00a0even though I trim the price as much as possible I will not get the job. What is disturbing is many of these contracts are being awarded at 1990 level prices. I had an old client and friend tell me when I first went into business, \"you know you can be busy as the dickens and still go broke\". He told me this when I gave him a quote on the first job I did for him, He looked at my quote and those were the first words out of his mouth. Then he told me, \" go back and redo this\u00a0\u00a0and make yourself some money, I am not looking for the cheapest surveyor I am looking for one I can trust and trust the work he does\".

Say a neighbor moves a fence or wall, or plants trees or a bush. If he encroaches on your property, and no one notices, he can claim \"continuous, exclusive, open and notorious\" use of that land -- and if he's able to do so for an average of 10 years in most states, he may be able to claim ownership. This could potentially add tens of thousands of dollars onto the value of his property while reducing the value of yours. But most people don't check their land boundaries until it's too late, Zierman says. \"You may not want to make a fuss because you're neighbors,\" he says. By the time it becomes a real issue -- you're selling your house, or your neighbor is -- securing the boundaries is important, and fighting to get the land back can cost tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees.\"</p>\n<p>Knowing where your boundaries are can save you problems down the road, if you are in Wisconsin, give Bosshard Surveying a call at 920-293-4001, we can help you so you know exactly where your boundaries are, for much less than it\u00a0<em>could</em>\u00a0cost you! \u00a0Don't let someone else rob you of your valuable property.</p>","createdDate":"2012-01-11T23:58:32.065Z","updatedDate":"2018-11-10T11:14:40.851Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2012-01-11T23:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:94119","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"<p>know your boundaries...because we do...</p>","createdDate":"2012-03-08T03:25:00.880Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:87590","contributorName":"1mf0x989oaasp","title":"Survey Wisconsin in a day results...","description":"<p><a href=\"http://filusland.com/2012/01/07/wisconsin-wasnt-surveyed-in-a-day-well-actually-it-was/\" target=\"_blank\">Survey Wisconsin in a day</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sco.wisc.edu/news/surveying-wisconsin-in-a-day.html\" title=\"Here\">Here</a> is a link to an article recently published by the <a href=\"http://www.sco.wisc.edu/\">Wisconsin State Cartographer\u2019s Office</a> describing the events of \u201cSurveying Wisconsin in a day\u201d.</p>\n<p>Dozens of member surveyors of the <a href=\"http://www.wsls.org/\">Wisconsin Society of Land Surveyors</a> around the state simultaneously operated Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to create a massive network of observations, being the largest ever on record for one day in Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>I was proud to be a participant in the event.

He was born March 20, 1875 and started keeping a diary a few months before he turned 22. He lived in East Texas during the time and he worked on survey crews and did a lot of surveying as a young man. His first entries in his diary in January of 1897 are crude chaining notes. Later it is clear he is operating the transit and level. As the year of 1897 wears on his diary becomes more detailed. Below is a selection of passages involving a survey of the Hiram Brown League in East Texas in late 1897.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tuesday 14, December 1897</p>\n<p>Went to work for Pepperkorn Surveying the McKinney &amp; Hiram Brown Leagues. Went to Mrs. Keiths and could not find corners, went to Mrs Bs and started South.</p>\n<p>Wednesday 15, December 1897</p>\n<p>Finished South of line and ran East &amp; stopped. Started from Mrs Bs and meandered marsh all the rest of day. Stopped below Merriman at night.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thursday 16, December 1897</p>\n<p>Started at Merriman and meandered river below old fort. Cut across marsh to Mrs. Keiths started South on lines stopped North of Jack Beaumonts house.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Friday 17, December 1897</p>\n<p>Started at Beaumonts and ran South below Railroad the turned East and stopped in Fublie R. it came a northern about 9 oclock and misted rain all day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Saturday 18, September 1897</p>\n<p>It rained fine mist all morning went out in evening and ran 2160 varas on South line of McKinney began to mist rain and we went into cars.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sunday 19, December 1897</p>\n<p>It misted rain all morning but the sun came out late in the evening. Rode Bruce to Beaumont after mail. Paul Harry &amp; Larry came over.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Monday 20, December 1897</p>\n<p>Went to see AB in morning and went out and ran East line of McKinney in the afternoon. It was cloudy and misted rain nearly all day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tuesday 21, December 1897</p>\n<p>It rained all day I loafed and cut a little wood went to see AB and help him load some shell.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Wednesday 22, December 1897</p>\n<p>Went out on line and worked till noon and it was very cold and rained and we came into the cars.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thursday 23, December 1897</p>\n<p>Went out and started from Hoovers and ran East to corner and then ran North to corner of B. Then meandered marsh the rest of the day. Pepperkorn killed 7 quail as we came home.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Friday 24, December 1897</p>\n<p>Went from Bluff to Beaumont in buggie and it rained all day and was muddy as hell. Got home 7 oclock wet and cold. Paid Maggie Vanwormer 30 dollars for Dixie.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Saturday 25, December 1897</p>\n<p>Spent a dull day at the Bluff. Kate Mary Clara and Ivy came over in the evening went to Nelsons to a party had a very good time came home with Mary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sunday 26, December 1897</p>\n<p>Went to see Henry Histler in the morning and AB and I took a walk up to Smith Bluff in the evening it was cloudy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Monday 27, December 1897</p>\n<p>Went out with Pepperkorn and worked all day but Northeast corner of Hiram Brown league was in the lake I and AB got very cold coming home sun shown all day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tuesday 28, December 1897</p>\n<p>Worked all day running down lake the first thing this morning and it was cold and frosty. The Klondikers have a good stitch of land.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Wednesday 29, December 1897</p>\n<p>Finished survey of Hiram Brown League in morning and went to Beaumont in the afternoon with AB to see the Night of the Circus it was a good show.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>","createdDate":"2012-01-04T19:03:45.298Z","updatedDate":"2015-08-21T06:24:26.659Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2012-01-04T19:00:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:85391","contributorName":"0ar5irv2v8h2l","title":"Caveat emptor!","description":"<p><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino;\" class=\"font-size-3\">Caveat emptor! Translation: Let the buyer beware! Under this doctrine, the buyer could not recover from the seller defects on the property that would render the property unfit for ordinary purposes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino;\" class=\"font-size-3\">The purchase of an automobile is typically the second most expensive purchase that people make. Prior to shelling out their hard-earned money though, they research their choice. They take the vehicle for a test-drive. If it is a used vehicle, they might even have their mechanic look over the car to ensure that it is a worthwhile purchase. People expend a good deal of effort, and sometimes money investigating a vehicle prior to making the purchasing decision. It makes sense after all, it is wise to understand just exactly what you are getting when spending a few tens of thousands of dollars on a vehicle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino;\" class=\"font-size-3\">The purchase of real estate is without doubt the most expensive investment that most people make in their lifetime. I have found that most people do not take the same effort to determine exactly what they are purchasing when it comes to real estate. They rely on the seller to tell them where the lot lines are, or perhaps the realtor might show them that the property line runs from the power pole to the telephone box in the back yard. The value of having a survey of the property is worth much more than the money that is invested in it. A survey will show the purchaser exactly what they are buying. It will also show if there are any problems with the property, such as buildings over the lot lines, a neighbor using a portion of the property, or the exact size of the property being different than listed in the documents. Most people have title insurance on their property, and assume that this will cover problems such as these, but it will not. Title insurance exempts payments on any issue that would be found with a survey of the property. Another reason to have a survey done prior to purchasing real estate!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino;\" class=\"font-size-3\">But what should a survey cost? Well, that is a very hard question to answer, and one that there cannot be a one price fits all! Every lot, home, legal description, deed, subdivision, easement, roadway, section, property and transaction is different. All surveys need to be looked at and a price determined on a case by case basis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino;\" class=\"font-size-3\">There are some companies that offer a \u201cLocation Survey\u201d for a low price. They then go on and explain that the service that they are offering is not actually a survey at all. A typical case of \u201cyou get what you pay for.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino;\" class=\"font-size-3\">A few tips when looking for a surveyor in Wisconsin: Ensure that they are licensed to practice Surveying in Wisconsin. This can be done at the <a href=\"http://drl.wi.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Safety &amp; Professional Services</a>\u00a0website. Ask if the survey they will provide will meet the standards set forth in Wisconsin\u2019s Administrative Code Chapter A-E 7.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino;\" class=\"font-size-3\">I hope that following this information will save everyone purchasing Real Estate money, time &amp; frustration.</span></p>","createdDate":"2011-12-24T03:30:16.091Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-06T15:02:35.753Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-12-24T03:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:85669","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","description":"<p>Hot diggity dawg!\u00a0 Brilliant read!</p>","createdDate":"2011-12-28T00:04:13.424Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:85404","contributorName":"3nl0xlaj4f88n","description":"<p>Hi,there.Michael Elbert from Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>The potential purchaser relies on his \u00a0realtor to do the job and will hire a surveyor only when smth</p>\n<p>really looks fishy</p>","createdDate":"2011-12-24T18:11:25.682Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:85304","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"<p>Another home run David.

He would only\u00a0say that he needed the survey for a\u00a0possible transaction on the properties\u00a0in the future and that there was no\u00a0Title Insurance Company involved.\u00a0Jack told us he had heard about us\u00a0from a lawyer he knew. He signed the\u00a0proposal and we proceeded to begin\u00a0work on his project. Jack warned us\u00a0not to speak to the people occupying\u00a0the southerly parcel of the 2 subject\u00a0parcels.</p>\n<p>The initial field trip did not turn up\u00a0anything significant other than the\u00a0southerly subject parcel was being\u00a0accessed via a paved road over a portion\u00a0of the northerly subject parcel.\u00a0The boundaries of the parcels seemed\u00a0certain and a partial chain of title was\u00a0then assembled on the original lot the\u00a02 subject parcels where out of. The\u00a0original lot now consisted of a total of\u00a03 parcels of with the subject parcels\u00a0were 2. We were surveying the southerly\u00a0and northerly parcels only with the\u00a03rd parcel comprising the rest of the\u00a0original lot adjoining them to the west.\u00a0Current tax records and the current\u00a0and old tax mosaics were pulled. We\u00a0hoped to find some mention of the\u00a0apparent access easement crossing the northerly subject tract to reach the\u00a0southerly subject tract.</p>\n<p>A very interesting history of the original\u00a0lot began to emerge from the evidence\u00a0and records. The original lot had been\u00a0acquired by one individual in the\u00a01950s who then conveyed 2 parcels\u00a0out of it to relatives. He retained 1\u00a0parcel in the southerly portion of the lot\u00a0that was land locked by the other conveyances.\u00a0Later he built a warehouse\u00a0on the southerly retained parcel and\u00a0constructed a paved road across the\u00a0north parcel he had conveyed to a relative\u00a0to reach the existing road. Multitudes\u00a0of transactions had occurred\u00a0since on all 3 parcels but all of these\u00a0transactions were apparently between\u00a0the same relatives with the exception\u00a0of the west 3rd parcel which was conveyed\u00a0in 2004 to a party outside the\u00a0family by a family Trust. The southerly\u00a0retained parcel had but one extremely\u00a0poor description from a conveyance to\u00a0a family member who was part of the\u00a0Trust in 1976 which indicated it was\u00a0junior or the final remainder. It could\u00a0not be located on the ground from the\u00a0description unless it was read in light\u00a0of the previous conveyances out of the\u00a0original lot.</p>\n<p>In 1978 the original owner of the entire\u00a0lot passed away and the 2 subject\u00a0parcels were made part of a family\u00a0Trust along with the western 3rd parcel\u00a0that formed the owner\u2019s estate of the\u00a0entire lot. The same relatives that had\u00a0been involved in the various transactions\u00a0on the 2 subject parcels were\u00a0listed as beneficiaries of the Trust.</p>\n<p>Apparently the tax maps and tax reports\u00a0on the 3 parcels comprising the original\u00a0lot had become scrambled over the\u00a0years. It appeared that the owner (who\u00a0was not a relative of the original lot\u00a0owner) that had acquired the west 3rd\u00a0parcel in 2004 out of the lot from the\u00a0family Trust was paying taxes on the\u00a0southerly subject parcel. Conversely the\u00a0owner of the southerly subject parcel\u00a0(which was the family Trust) was paying\u00a0taxes on the west 3rd parcel. Jack was\u00a0paying taxes on the northerly subject\u00a0parcel that had been conveyed to him\u00a0in 2009 by the family Trust.</p>\n<p>The Standard Land Survey was prepared\u00a0along with a Surveyor\u2019s report\u00a0explaining the problems with the missing\u00a0access easement and the taxing\u00a0problems. A meeting was then set up\u00a0with Jack.</p>\n<p>After Jack was told about the various\u00a0problems he confessed that he had\u00a0purchased both the northerly and\u00a0southerly tracts of land in 2009. I explained\u00a0to Jack that his vesting Deed did not indicate this and was only for\u00a0the northerly parcel. Jack stated that\u00a0the Deed was wrong and should have\u00a0included the southerly parcel. He said\u00a0that he had purchased both parcels\u00a0without a Land Survey and that he had\u00a0been told by the Realtor and the seller\u00a0that both parcels were part of the sale.\u00a0He had obtained keys after the closing\u00a0for both properties and he thought\u00a0nothing more about it until he tried to\u00a0convey the southerly parcel to a third\u00a0party a few months earlier.</p>\n<p>The third party was suing Jack for\u00a0fraud because they discovered he did\u00a0not have title to the southerly subject\u00a0parcel. The third party turned out to be\u00a0the people who were currently occupying\u00a0the southerly subject parcel. They\u00a0had made a deal with the owner\u00a0(family Trust) of the southerly tract,\u00a0before Jack obtained it, to pay the\u00a0taxes on the southerly parcel as part\u00a0of their rent they paid on it. The third\u00a0party was actually paying taxes on the\u00a0westerly parcel of land out of the lot.\u00a0The tax bills arrived at the southerly\u00a0parcel\u2019s address for the westerly parcel\u00a0which they dutifully paid for more\u00a0than 20 years not realizing that it was\u00a0a tax bill for the west parcel.</p>\n<p>When Jack had obtained the property\u00a0the third party signed an agreement with him stating that the previous arrangement\u00a0would continue with the rent and tax\u00a0bills and that is why Jack had never\u00a0thought about his tax bill that was only\u00a0for the northerly parcel. It was only\u00a0after the third party had approached\u00a0Jack to purchase the southerly parcel\u00a0they were renting that this mess finally\u00a0blew up.</p>\n<p>I told Jack he should have told me this\u00a0before he hired me and I advised him\u00a0on how to correct this problem for little\u00a0or no money. Jack thanked me but said \u00a0that he was taking the results of the\u00a0Land Survey to his lawyers so they could\u00a0tell him what to do next.

He said he had read\u00a0some positive reports about our firm\u00a0and that is why he was contacting us.\u00a0A current tax mosaic was pulled showing\u00a0the lot in question along with the\u00a0current tax report for his lot and then\u00a0sent along with a proposal with a price\u00a0and time frame for an Investigative\u00a0Survey that would we felt would suit\u00a0is needs. I explained to Joe in writing\u00a0and over the phone how I thought the\u00a0process should proceed regarding\u00a0purchasing the strip. I advised him to\u00a0contact a lawyer and provided phone\u00a0numbers for a few of them. I also explained\u00a0that it may not be necessary to\u00a0hire a lawyer and that I could prepare\u00a0and file this paperwork for him if he so\u00a0desired.</p>\n<p>The next day the proposal was sent\u00a0back signed so we started work on this\u00a0project. The initial visit to the site\u00a0showed Joe appeared to be occupying\u00a0about 4\u2019 of land out of the adjoining\u00a0lot. The current tax mosaic, the current\u00a0tax report, the vesting Deed into Joe\u00a0from 1986 all described just the lot\u00a0only. There seemed to be something\u00a0wrong because improvements that\u00a0were occupying the 4\u2019 strip adjoining\u00a0Joe\u2019s lot were reported to appear to be\u00a0in excess of 30 years in age.</p>\n<p>The vesting Deed was pulled for the\u00a0adjoiner, despite the fact that the current\u00a0tax mosaic and the current tax\u00a0report showed the adjoiner owning the\u00a0entire lot. The adjoining vesting Deed\u00a0dating to 1998 was for the entire lot,\u00a0save and except the north 4\u2019 (the strip\u00a0in question). A search was then made\u00a0of the chain of title going back to the\u00a0original owners of either lot. It turned\u00a0out the adjoiner\u2019s predecessor in title\u00a0had conveyed Joe\u2019s predecessor in title\u00a0the 4\u2019 strip in 1976. Joe\u2019s land had\u00a0changed hands 6 times since then and\u00a0the 4\u2019 strip had never been mentioned\u00a0in any of those conveyances. Land\u00a0Survey after Land Survey, Title Policy\u00a0after Title Policy had failed to identify\u00a0this problem. The Land Survey performed\u00a0for Joe\u2019s closing in 1986 just\u00a0showed the fence and other improvements\u00a04\u2019 over the boundary. The adjoiner\u2019s\u00a0property had changed hands 3\u00a0times since 1976 and each description\u00a0was for the lot save and except the 4\u2019\u00a0strip, however the tax reports and tax\u00a0mosaic had never changed. Apparently\u00a0the original transaction for the 4\u2019 strip\u00a0had never been reported to the Tax\u00a0Assessor Collectors Office and the handlers\u00a0of the subsequent transactions on\u00a0the adjoining property had failed to\u00a0report the absence of the 4\u2019 strip to\u00a0them as well.</p>\n<p>A Land Survey was prepared with an\u00a0attached Surveyor\u2019s report and Joe was\u00a0contacted. We explained the situation to\u00a0him in writing and in person so he\u00a0would fully understand the results.\u00a0What we had found indicated a condition\u00a0whereby the adjoiner had been\u00a0paying taxes on a 4\u2019 strip they did not\u00a0own since 1976. Joe was in possession\u00a0of the 4\u2019 strip of land that he had no title\u00a0to and what was worse was none of his\u00a0predecessors in title had title to the 4\u2019\u00a0strip since the original buyer of it conveyed\u00a0the lot in 1978. Neither Joe nor\u00a0any of his predecessors in title had ever\u00a0paid taxes on the 4\u2019 strip.</p>\n<p>I advised Joe on various ways I thought\u00a0the problem could be eliminated for\u00a0little or no money and the drawbacks\u00a0and difficulties that each cure might\u00a0entail. I advised Joe to seek the council\u00a0of a lawyer and gave him some phone\u00a0numbers of some lawyers I know who had experience with this type of specific problem.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joe was very upset and said that he\u00a0was going to sue the Title Insurance\u00a0Company, the Land Surveyor who did\u00a0his survey in 1986 and his lender. I told\u00a0him this may not be possible in some of\u00a0those cases and told him he should\u00a0consult a lawyer.</p>\n<p>I urged him to consider the alternatives\u00a0I had outlined for fixing this problem\u00a0for relatively little money and aggravation\u00a0compared to a lawsuit. Joe said he would contact me.</p>\n<p>Phone messages to Joe have gone\u00a0unanswered and we have not heard\u00a0from him for months now. I hope for\u00a0his own sake he calls back sometime\u00a0soon.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>PART 3 \"STRIP SEARCH\" to come....</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><br/></b></p>\n<p><b><br/></b></p>","createdDate":"2011-12-12T11:27:13.329Z","updatedDate":"2018-10-05T08:59:20.044Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-12-12T11:27:13.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:82575","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","title":"Stripper: Confessions of a Land Surveyor","description":"<p><strong>S t r i p p e r : \u00a0C o n f e s s i o n s \u00a0o f \u00a0a \u00a0L a n d \u00a0S u r v e y o r</strong><br/><strong>B y \u00a0P e a n \u00a0C h e n e y i n g \u00a0P L S</strong></p>\n<p>(Originally published in Gulf Coast Surveyor, September 2011 under the column \"Chain!\")</p>\n<p><br/><b><u>PART 1</u></b></p>\n<p><b><u><a href=\"http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.88992.1313875218!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/image.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.88992.1313875218!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/image.jpg\" class=\"align-left\"/></a></u></b></p>\n<p><br/><strong>Striptease</strong></p>\n<p><br/>I received a phone call from Joanne\u00a0who said she was purchasing a home\u00a0on a lot in a block of a recorded subdivision.\u00a0She said she needed a Land\u00a0Title Survey. I pulled the current tax\u00a0report on the property, the current tax\u00a0mosaic showing the property and sent\u00a0her these along with a proposal for the\u00a0service and product. This particular\u00a0Land Survey did not seem to be much\u00a0of a challenge. The current tax mosaic\u00a0showed the property in question was\u00a0only the recorded lot. The current tax\u00a0report indicated the owner had been\u00a0paying taxes on an area the size of the\u00a0lot for a number of years.</p>\n<p>Joanne called back and explained to\u00a0me that she had read some positive\u00a0reports about our firm on the Web and\u00a0this is why she had contacted us. She\u00a0expressed some apprehension about\u00a0hiring us because the price we\u00a0charged was 25% more than another<br/>Land Surveying firm that was recommended\u00a0by her Title Insurance Company.\u00a0She said the Title Insurance\u00a0Company had insisted they would order\u00a0the survey for her from their\u00a0\u201cpreferred Land Surveyor\u201d and that\u00a0she would not have to pay anything for\u00a0it as the lender would roll it into the\u00a0closing fees. She also mentioned that\u00a0her Realtor had told her that our fees\u00a0were too high, that we might delay the\u00a0closing and advised her to let the Title\u00a0Insurance Company take care of it.</p>\n<p>I pointed out that our time frame was\u00a0the same as the other Land Surveyor,\u00a0that you get what you pay for as far as\u00a0the fee and that we were independent\u00a0Land Surveyors who had no vested\u00a0interest in her purchasing the property\u00a0in question. I told her the arrangement\u00a0with the other Land Surveyor would\u00a0only mean that the fee for the Land\u00a0Survey would be rolled into her loan on\u00a0the property. Over the time period of\u00a0the loan terms she would end up paying\u00a0far more for the other Land Survey\u00a0later.</p>\n<p>She seemed surprised at my statements\u00a0and stated that she had no idea\u00a0how transactions worked. She said she\u00a0would look into it and call me back. A\u00a0couple of days later she sent the\u00a0signed proposal back with a copy of\u00a0the Title Insurance Commitment. We\u00a0started work on her project.</p>\n<p>Our initial visit to the site turned up\u00a0nothing unusual other than the fence\u00a0and a portion of the driveway seemed\u00a0to extend beyond the south boundary\u00a0of the recorded lot by as much as 3\u00a0feet. The Title Insurance Commitment\u00a0was only for the recorded lot. The tax\u00a0records for this lot and the adjoining\u00a0lots only showed the owners paying\u00a0taxes on the area of their respective\u00a0lots. The tax mosaic only showed the\u00a0recorded lot. The vesting Deed of the\u00a0seller dating to 1978 was pulled for\u00a0the property and it was only for the\u00a0recorded lot.</p>\n<p>Something seemed wrong and the\u00a0vesting Deeds for the adjoining properties\u00a0were pulled. Again there was nothing\u00a0unusual in the transactions and all\u00a0of them were for the full lots only. Finally\u00a0a search was made for transactions\u00a0between the owner of the subject \u00a0tract and other entities. This is when a\u00a0transaction from 1979 between the\u00a0current owner and the adjoiner for a 3\u2019\u00a0strip southerly of and adjoining the\u00a0south boundary of the subject lot was\u00a0discovered. It appeared that although\u00a0the transaction had been recorded at\u00a0the County Clerk\u2019s office it was never\u00a0reported to the Tax Assessor Collectors\u00a0Office and thus the adjoiner who conveyed\u00a0the 3\u2019 strip had continued to pay\u00a0taxes on it.</p>\n<p>A Land Survey was prepared showing\u00a0the lot as tract 1 and the 3\u2019 strip as\u00a0tract 2 along with an attached Surveyor\u2019s\u00a0report explaining the situation\u00a0with a stipulation that the survey was\u00a0based on the presumption that the\u00a0seller intended to convey all the land\u00a0they owned. When the Land Survey was\u00a0delivered to Joanna I made a point of\u00a0calling her and going over the problem\u00a0we had uncovered. She seemed to understand\u00a0the situation and said she\u00a0would contact the seller.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately after we released\u00a0the Land Survey we received a phone\u00a0call from a representative at the Title\u00a0Insurance Company stating it was\u00a0wrong and that we needed to correct it\u00a0right away to show only the lot and not\u00a0the 3\u2019 strip. The representative said if\u00a0we did not get the revised Land Survey\u00a0to them in the next hour our actions\u00a0would delay the closing. I refused to\u00a0revise the Land Survey and I explained\u00a0to the representative the problems I\u00a0had found and emailed a copy of the\u00a0Deed to the 3\u2019 strip to them.</p>\n<p>Very shortly thereafter I received another\u00a0phone call from Joanna saying\u00a0that the Realtor had contacted her to\u00a0say that our Land Survey was wrong\u00a0and that we had delayed her closing.\u00a0She told us that she had been in contact\u00a0with the seller and that the seller\u00a0had told her that they forgotten about\u00a0the transaction for the 3\u2019 strip in 1979\u00a0and that they intended to convey it to\u00a0her with the lot. I explained to her that\u00a0what we had found potentially saved\u00a0her thousands of dollars of legal fees\u00a0and headaches in the future. I told her\u00a0to sit tight and let the various parties\u00a0involved work it out.</p>\n<p>A few days later the closing occurred\u00a0on both the lot and the 3\u2019 strip with no\u00a0modifications to the Land Survey originally\u00a0provided by us. Joanna called to\u00a0tell us how happy she was with our\u00a0service and how lucky she felt that she\u00a0had the good sense to hire us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>PART 2 \"STRIP NAKED\" to come....</b></p>","createdDate":"2011-12-11T15:39:13.793Z","updatedDate":"2017-03-17T22:47:46.091Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-12-11T15:39:13.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:83383","contributorName":"3lqzrr91m7ujl","description":"<p>Hallow Deward,</p>\n<p>This proves the potentiality of Land Surveyor.\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: black; line-height: 140%; font-family: Verdana;\">He is\u00a0the intermediary between reality and imaginary.

Part 3","description":"<p><span>So last time we did a cursory\u00a0<a href=\"http://rlsdave.com/2011/12/04/what-is-land-surveying-a-land-survey-or-a-surveyor-part-2/\"><span>review of the PLSS</span></a>\u00a0and went over the basics of simple legal descriptions. \u00a0We start the survey process at the office looking up the original surveys for the area, I\u2019m a history buff so I love reading the original notes, and looking at the original maps. Then we head to the courthouse to research deeds for not just the parcel of land that we are surveying, but also all of the adjoining deeds to look for any issues that may involve junior or senior rights. Then we head to the County Surveyor\u2019s office to look for any surveys that have been done and filed with the surveyor (as required by law). We also obtain any information the surveyor may have on the location of those section corners, most often referred to as \u201ctie-sheets\u201d these sheets show the section corner, and any ties (an accessory to show where the monument is).</span></p>\n<p><span>After our research is done, we head to the site. Some sections are easier to work in than others. Here are two images of Sections with the W 1/2 of the NE 1/4 and the NE 1/4 of the NE 1/4 outlined. \u00a0The easier of the two has roads on the section lines and nice plowed fields to work in and around, the other has a road along the North line, but no other roads, and is fairly heavily wooded with a nice stream on the property. \u00a0Always remember no two surveys are EVER the same, even if they are the same size!</span></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/easy2.jpg\"><span><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-368\" title=\"easy\" src=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/easy2-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"270\" height=\"270\"/></span></a><a href=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/hard3.jpg\"><span><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-369\" title=\"hard\" src=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/hard3-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"270\" height=\"270\"/></span></a></span></p>\n<p>For our example we are going to be surveying the parcel on the left, the \u201ceasy\u201d survey. \u00a0In order to survey this parcel, we are going to need to recover the following corners: NE 1/4, E 1/4, S 1/4, W 1/4, and N 1/4. \u00a0We arrive on site and begin our\u00a0reconnaissance\u00a0for the corners we need.</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ga72_magnetic_locator.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ga72_magnetic_locator-199x300.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ga72_magnetic_locator-199x300.jpg?width=119\" width=\"119\" class=\"align-left\"/></a></span>We get out our trusty metal locator and begin the search. \u00a0We look over the tie sheets and find the called for monuments and all 4 of the ties listed the E 1/4, NE 1/4, and N 1/4 corners. \u00a0We drive over to the West 1/4 and find that the county department recently repaved the road, and using the metal locator there is a strong indication of a monument there. \u00a0We check the tie distances and find that they all meet at the spot in the road where the strongest indication of the monument is. \u00a0We start our work to find the monument, with hammer, chisel, spoon, and whisk broom. \u00a0Eventually we wind up with a nice clean hole cut through the asphalt, and all the gravel and dirt dug out of the hole and a clear view of the monument we were searching for.<a href=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SLIMLINE-HARRISON.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-372\" title=\"SLIMLINE-HARRISON\" src=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SLIMLINE-HARRISON-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"/></a>We now have 4 out of 5 monuments to work on this survey. \u00a0We drive down to the S 1/4 corner. \u00a0Upon arrival at the estimated location of the corner we perform a diligent search for the witness monuments shown on the 1972 Land Corner Certificate of record. We found only 1 of the 3 record witness monuments existing. The one we found was a PK Nail with a shiner in a power pole 142\u2032 away. The other two witness monuments were also PK Nails with shiners one in a gate post, and the other in a fence corner. \u00a0Neither of these posts are existing at the location indicated. \u00a0A search finds the posts lying in a tree line rotted out, but with PK Nail and shiner still intact but rendered useless by their location. We then do an exhaustive search for other monuments from surveys that have been conducted in this area since 1972. We use our metal locator to search for an indication of a monument in the roadway at the 142\u2032 feet from the one existing tie. \u00a0We find an indication of a monument but is appears to be very deep. \u00a0We again grab out equipment and start to excavate a hole where the corner\u00a0<em>hopefully\u00a0</em>is. \u00a0We wind up digging down 0.90\u2032 to a Slimline Harrison monument. \u00a0Wanting to be sure that the monument is in the proper location we also locate the SE 1/4 and SW 1/4 corners. \u00a0We find that the S 1/4 corner is good where we have found it based on other surveys that show the relationship between it, the N 1/4 corner, and both the SE 1/4, and SW 1/4 corners.\u00a0<a href=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/deep.jpg\"><br/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/deep.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-373\" title=\"deep\" src=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/deep.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"/></a></p>\n<p><span>We have traversed to all 5 monuments needed to determine where our boundaries are. We compare our findings with those of the other surveys of record and determine that\u00a0</span>the distances and angular relationships between the section monuments are all good. Now we are able to determine where the Center 1/4 corner is, our actual southwest lot corner. \u00a0We traverse to our calculated Center 1/4 corner and find a 1\u2033 diameter iron rod at the calculated coordinates.</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/center1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-382\" title=\"center\" src=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/center1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\"/></a>The rest of the survey works out just perfect. \u00a0A beautiful November day 40 degrees, and sunny. \u00a0We get the survey taken care of drafted up, and sent out. \u00a0We file a copy with the county Surveyor so there will be a record of what we did. \u00a0You might think that we\u2019re done but we aren\u2019t. \u00a0We have some additional work if you remember back to part 2 we talked about one of the most\u00a0<a title=\"Important surveyor function\" href=\"http://rlsdave.com/2011/12/04/what-is-land-surveying-a-land-survey-or-a-surveyor-part-2/\">important jobs surveyors</a>\u00a0have to do and we will cover that next time, in part 4 of this series.</span></p>\n<p><span>As usual if you have any questions, please ask! \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>RLS Dave</span></p>","createdDate":"2011-12-09T03:58:39.171Z","updatedDate":"2019-01-05T19:49:50.493Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-12-09T03:58:39.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:82228","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"<p>Fabulous.

I had this whole article typed and in this box and hit submit and the page failed to load. It got lost in the digital wasteland that is wifi to my router and on to the internet to the sever that is LSU. where did it go?? I dont know but if I typed it local and hit save then copied and pasted it I would have a backup. Thats where we start... AGAIN..</p>\n<p>Well for those who dont know me yet.. My Name is Daniel Beltz. Want to know more? Feel free to visit my profile and or contact me directly. I am happy to talk to you and give you any help I can.</p>\n<p>Why backup?</p>\n<p>Superheroes need it, police rely on it and everyone that uses a computer should use some form of it. In the world of mainframes and microchips it's called data backup or data recovery and it can mean the difference between a slight computer setback and living through your own electronic apocalypse.</p>\n<p>Let's face it; our computers are a bigger part of life than ever before. We shop, work and play using computers. They've replaced stereos, encyclopedias, even the mailman. They've become journals, photo albums and canvases for our art.</p>\n<p>But computers aren't perfect. Files become corrupt, motherboards malfunction, CPUs call it quits taking our precious data with them.</p>\n<p>The best defense is data backup software. Backing up data is vital for businesses; lost information can cause a major crisis or worse, lead to business failure. Individuals who don't backup computer data run the same risk. While this may not cause financial ruin, it can certainly be frustrating and even heartbreaking. So why do so few of us practice data backup?</p>\n<p>Here are the common excuses:<br/> \"I'm too busy to backup my computer.\" We are busy, work, family and friends fill our days and leave us little time for boring things like computer maintenance. But today's backup software manufacturers make it easy. Through scheduled backups, your system can automatically perform a backup that fits your needs at an interval you choose\u2014without interrupting life.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know how to backup data.\" Like preparing for a natural disaster, most of us understand how important data backup is, but don't know where to start. A big step is deciding how you are going to store the data you backup.</p>\n<p>One option is Removable Backup Media, but this only narrows the field a little. You could buy a million 3.5\" discs or perhaps invest in a larger-capacity external Zip drive. You could take the plunge into writeable CDs or stretch out your legs with the help of an external hard drive and Network Attached Storage or a full file server.</p>\n<p>Another good data backup option is to backup to an FTP location, which allows you to backup a file, a folder or your entire hard drive to a separate location online.</p>\n<p>\"My computer won't crash.\" You've had your computer this long and haven't had problems so far why worry about computer backup now? Think about it you wear your seat belt even though you don't expect your car to crash everyday. Data backup is about protecting your data's future, but with computers, it isn't if you crash, it's when you crash.</p>\n<p>In today's high-tech world of sneaky spyware and venomous viruses, you are in more danger of data loss than ever before. Computer viruses grew by as much as 20% during 2010 alone costing business $55\u00a0Billion\u00a0yes with a B.</p>\n<p>Like tires on your car, the electronic circuits your computer rides on will eventually wear down and blow out. When this happens, you can either grieve at your loss or simply restore your data with data backup software.</p>\n<p>So with that said, how does one choose the right backup software and hardware? There are many varieties available\u2014some suited to a growing business and others for well established. Some backup software is for technical experts, other packages for the technically challenged. To help you choose, I am here. I am not going to go into the large scale systems. For those I figure you already have a full time IT guy. I am trying to help the places that have 1 to 10 employee's. Will this help the larger companies YES. But you also have a unique set of\u00a0challenges\u00a0and that is between you and your IT guy. But here are some tools to help you be lets say smarter about the conversation. If you\u00a0don't\u00a0have a full time IT guy you have me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are many types of backup.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Optical which includes CD-R, DVD-R, DVD-DL, BD-R, BD-DL</p>\n<p>Flash Based which includes Pen/Thumb/Key chain\u00a0USB\u00a0drives, Compact Flash, SD Card, and Solid State Disk Drive (SSD)</p>\n<p>Hard Drive which includes RAID, Network\u00a0Attached\u00a0Storage (NAS), or a full file server.</p>\n<p>Online this can\u00a0include\u00a0offsite (Home office or second office location) FTP/Mapped Drive or an online software vendor you pay for off site storage.</p>\n<p>Lets start with the Pros and Cons of each.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"500\">\n<colgroup><col span=\"2\" width=\"64\"></col><col width=\"87\"></col><col width=\"111\"></col><col width=\"110\"></col><col width=\"64\"></col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class=\"xl71\" height=\"26\" width=\"500\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"font-size-3\"><strong>Weighing the options: Pros and cons</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td class=\"xl65\" height=\"21\" width=\"64\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"5\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td class=\"xl66\" height=\"46\" width=\"64\" style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" width=\"64\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Capacities</strong></td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" width=\"87\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Price Range/Per GB</strong></td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" width=\"111\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Pros</strong></td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" width=\"110\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Cons</strong></td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" width=\"64\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Best uses</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td class=\"xl67\" height=\"137\" width=\"64\"><strong>Two internal drives in a RAID 1 array</strong></td>\n<td class=\"xl68\" width=\"64\">500GB to 3TB</td>\n<td class=\"xl68\" width=\"87\">$60 - $400 for second drive, depending on capacity/$0.13 -$0.17 per\u00a0 GB</td>\n<td class=\"xl68\" width=\"111\">Fastest; can buy a PC preconfigured this way; no software is required; backups are immediate and automatic; large capacity; prevents data loss from a single drive failure.</td>\n<td class=\"xl68\" width=\"110\">Susceptible to malware, home theft, or disaster; one entire drive is dedicated solely to backup; can't recover accidentally deleted or overwritten files.</td>\n<td class=\"xl68\" width=\"64\">Immediate, automatic, hassle-free backups.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td class=\"xl69\" height=\"137\" width=\"64\"><strong>External Hard Drives</strong></td>\n<td class=\"xl70\" width=\"64\">500GB - 3TB (single drive)</td>\n<td class=\"xl70\" width=\"87\">$85 - $400/$0.13 - $0.17</td>\n<td class=\"xl70\" width=\"111\">Fastest for large capacities; inexpensive; connects via USB, firewire or eSATA; smaller models may require no external power.</td>\n<td class=\"xl70\" width=\"110\">Susceptible to malware, home theft, or disaster; must configure and run backup software.</td>\n<td class=\"xl70\" width=\"64\">Primary storage of large amounts of data.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td class=\"xl69\" height=\"290\" width=\"64\"><strong>Network Attached Storage</strong></td>\n<td class=\"xl70\" width=\"64\">1TB to 80TB+</td>\n<td class=\"xl70\" width=\"87\">$100 - $2000+</td>\n<td class=\"xl70\" width=\"111\">Fast for large capacities;\u00a0 no software is required; backups are immediate and automatic; extremely large capacity; prevents data loss from a single drive failure. inexpensive; connects via Ethernet to be accessed shared by more then one computer. can be accessed from remote locations for field workers.

Well it comes down to a couple questions.</p>\n<p>1.) What can I afford to lose?</p>\n<p>For most the answer is nothing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2.) How much storage do I need to backup up what I dont want to lose?</p>\n<p>I highly recommend a NAS device even if you\u00a0don't\u00a0have a full network. They are inexpensive and very reliable. You can have a bare NAS enclosure for around $200.</p>\n<p>3.) What features do I need and want in the future?</p>\n<p>Will you have off site workers? Do you want to give employees their own private folders and shared folders? Do you want 3TB of storage or 15TB of storage?\u00a0</p>\n<p>4.) What units have the most of those features in a price range I can afford.</p>\n<p>Can I afford $1000 or only $350? For a good unit for 1 to 5 users you will be around the $400 dollar mark with hard drives. It\u00a0doesn't\u00a0take much to move up from there. But you can have a top of the line 3 to 10 user unit in the 750 to 900 dollar range and well the prices go up from there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You may ask why I have not covered a ull file server here. Its because a NAS device is a File server but with a web based admin tool. They can do almost all the things of any other machine at the fraction of the cost. But after 10 Users there are\u00a0benefits\u00a0in other areas such as hosting your own web server, email and other things that your IT dept can discuss with you when you are ready to take that step.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you are interested in drives or network attached storage and other backup devices. please feel free to contact me as I can help you choose the unit that is right for your business.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Well I may come back and edit when I get back up but its 3am and I just re typed this all and want to get it published. Hope it helps some people.</p>","createdDate":"2011-12-08T05:30:57.654Z","updatedDate":"2017-08-16T18:19:56.968Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-12-08T08:03:24.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:97079","contributorName":"06khah8o47f92","description":"<p>Don't send this guy any money.

This is by no means a complete list but it is a good list to get you started and save a few bucks.</p>\n<p>AVAST<br/>The BEST antivirus out there in my experience is AVAST. It is fast, stable blocks everything that has ever tried to attack my system and doesn\u2019t slow my computer down like Norton or some of the others. I am not saying the others don\u2019t protect you. I am saying that SOME of them have become so bloated that they slow your system down and Avast just doesn\u2019t do that. Guess what its FREE for trying out and for home and personal use. So if you do work on your home system or are a small home surveyor you can use it and won\u2019t cost you a dime. Also it works in more than one language. So for those of you that are not native English speakers it comes in more than 30 languages at my last count. <br/>\u2022 Anti-spyware built-in<br/>\u2022 Web Shield<br/>\u2022 Anti-rootkit built-in<br/>\u2022 Automatic updates<br/>\u2022 Strong self-protection<br/>\u2022 Virus Chest<br/>\u2022 Antivirus kernel<br/>\u2022 System integration<br/>\u2022 Simple User Interface<br/>\u2022 Integrated Virus Cleaner<br/>\u2022 Resident protection<br/>\u2022 Support for 64-bit Windows<br/>\u2022 P2P and IM Shields<br/>\u2022 Internationalization<br/>\u2022 Network Shield<br/>Avast.com or Filehippo.com</p>\n<p>CCLEANER<br/>The Best general clean up tool to get rid of the garbage on your system is CCLEANER. Now what I mean by this is Internet temp files, internet history, memory dumps, leftovers from installs and un-installs, the remains of windows updates, There is so much more. I have run it on systems and removed as much as 10GB worth of garbage data. I have also seen it make improvements on speed in the 10 to 30% mark by this clean up. Will you always get this.. Sorry to say no. But I have seen a computer go from slow sluggish back to 100% usable. But here is my disclaimer.. I have never had a problem using it but you can use it to edit it the startup of your computer. I happen to know what I am doing when I go in to edit this part of the computers boot process but it is a side option and you could disable tablets and plotters that load this way. But running the standard cleanup will have no effect on that in any experience that I have done. One word of note, any folder that is labeled tmp or temp is fair game to get emptied if windows uses it to dump to.<br/>\u2022 Internet Explorer<br/>\u2022 Firefox<br/>\u2022 Google Chrome<br/>\u2022 Opera<br/>\u2022 Safari<br/>\u2022 Windows - Recycle Bin, Recent Documents, Temporary files and Log files.<br/>\u2022 Registry cleaner<br/>\u2022 Third-party applications<br/>\u2022 100% Spyware FREE<br/>Ccleaner.com or Filehippo.com</p>\n<p>MALWAREBYTES<br/>Great and Fast maleware scanner (FYI malware and viruses are not the same and cannot always be covered by the same scanner.) Malwarebyte's Anti Malware. It is fast and effective. It does have a paid version that I have never used but it has removed everything I have ever asked it to except for a few and those were some of the very worst out there. Then it becomes an outwit the bad things game that only experience brings. <br/>\u2022 Light speed quick scanning.<br/>\u2022 Ability to perform full scans for all drives.<br/>\u2022 Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware Protection Module.

Part 1 of as many as needed.","description":"<p>I have been talking with some of the wonderful folks on here and I think I can help some of you and learn from many of you. I am a computer and network systems engineer and by NO means a surveyor. So what brought me here.. Well when I was in school I worked as a survey tech and construction inspector for about 5 years and I still help my uncle as a rod man when he needs an extra hand on a weekend here and there. So let\u2019s get down to what brought me here. My uncles Recon is a little slow compared to some of his other equipment and the cable is intermittent. I noticed this when I was out on a survey with him in November. So as we talked through doing some TOPO and setting some corner\u2019s for a property survey I came up with the idea of a droid app that work sort of like his recon. Well I am well into software development mode. I am hoping I will have a nice program for him come this spring to play with and do some testing. Then work up from there.</p>\n<p>Well in my meetings with Justin, Gary, Skip, Richard, Scott, Dave and others. I have found that the manufactures of the equipment sell you the hard ware and then say have fun talk to you later for a fee, Well I am hoping to help as many people as I can. I do have a full time job and I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t want to make a little money but my goal to save everyone a lot of money. Here is how I am looking to do it. I am going to build Step by step repair manuals and attempt to stock the most common hardware to repair equipment. So I can repair or YOU can repair your equipment and know the deepest darkest secrets from the inside. I am talking touch screens, internal cables, battery cells, Cable ends like Lemo and Fisher. Anything that has been taken from the common market and used in survey equipment not tripods or tri-brachs.</p>\n<p>You ask what brought me to this.. Well I was talking to Justin and he referred me to Gary who has had a GPS unit broken for almost 3 years (2.5+). Ashtech wants an arm and a leg to repair it. Now it took me a week to come up with all the details for the parts. (But I didn\u2019t have the equipment sitting in front of me.) I did find the screen and digitizer numbers with much other help from other surveyors and tech people on this site.\u00a0 The difference with me is that I repair laptops, cell phones, network equipment, ipods and the like. So I am well experienced in removing the parts and pulling them apart and putting them back together. So with my knowledge I am going to build manuals as I repair or gain access to equipment to document the equipment tear-down and put back together. I am thinking step by step in a PDF and maybe a YOUTUBE video. I guess it will depend. This is all just getting started on that point. Gary's ProMark 3 is going to be the first to get the NorthStar treatment. I hope that you all will like this.</p>\n<p>I also have answered what seems to a computer person or engineers common sense questions. I AM HAPPY TO DO THIS.</p>\n<p>Why doesn\u2019t my new hard drive not work?</p>\n<p>Why doesn\u2019t my 4gb SD card work in my GPS unit but my 2GB SD does?</p>\n<p>Now here is my payoff. I am not asking for any donations. Or any pay of any type. Just consider us when you buy computer, electronic, communication and network equipment. If we don\u2019t have the best price and support to make it worth it don\u2019t by from us. We will do our best but in these tight times we understand sometimes it comes down to that last few penny's.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well I hope I have not babbled too much and I hope we can all help each other and see each other into the future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dan</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>","createdDate":"2011-12-06T05:13:46.604Z","updatedDate":"2014-09-20T07:57:40.241Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-12-06T05:00:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:77862","contributorName":"1ussnjim5b5q1","description":"<p>I would be willing to moderate and I can do a Q&amp;A as well.

In general, the PLSS typically divided land into 6-mile-square townships. \u00a0Townships are further subdivided into 36 one-mile-square sections.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/quarters.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-352\" title=\"quarters\" src=\"http://rlsdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/quarters-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>Sections are then further subdivided into quarter-sections, quarter-quarter-sections, or irregular lots called Government Lots. Permanent monuments, or markers, were placed at each section corner. Monuments are also placed at quarter-section corners and at other important points, such as the corners of government lots.

If you're going to have an account on sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Google+, devote the little bit of effort that it takes into keeping it engaging and regularly updated with fresh content. \u00a0Syncing your Facebook and Twitter accounts with your Land Surveyors United profile makes this super simple, as you can simply engage and share things about your company on LSU and we automatically send out the updates to your account for you.</li>\n<li><strong>Failing to link back to your website in social media profiles.</strong>\u00a0 YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ <span>all allow you to link back to your website</span>. There is simply no excuse for not doing this. \u00a0Not only is that five more links into your site, it's five more ways your hundreds or thousands of followers can get back to your site to find more information about your products and services. \u00a0Placing the link in your Land Surveyors United profile</li>\n<li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/landsurveyorsu\"><img width=\"200\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/rpOv1GKNXguTQgWR8-SpPG5EYE*QuDOkk8UMoTrwHrNCjHyFjxG5aojcEUub3uSStOZGAr2W0q2xP8U12c4Vow__/claimtwittername.png?width=200\" class=\"align-right\"/></a>Failing to claim your accounts.</strong>\u00a0Twitter handles get snatched up like wildfire, especially if your company name is somewhat common. And if you're a big brand name, you don't want to see Bank of America's\u00a0<a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://techland.time.com/2011/11/15/bank-of-americas-google-page-promises-revenge-against-protesters-wait-what/\" title=\"Google+ snafu\">Google+ snafu</a>\u00a0happen to you-you'll be sorry. If you are lazy about your claim and fail to lock-in your name on social networks, you miss out on great opportunities to rank for keywords in organic search, risk running into brand and PR issues down the road, and will ultimately end up having to compromise the name you select. \u00a0Sadly, many of the land surveying related profile names on Twitter like @landsurveyors and @land_surveyors for example are owned by people who have fallen victim to number one above. \u00a0Many of these great names were taken by people who didn't know what they were doing and never actually shared or tweeted anything at all....shame on you. Our twitter name for LSU (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/landsurveyorsu\">@landsurveyorsu</a>) was actually one letter too long to be @landsurveyorsunited, but due to the fact that we have recently begun <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/land-surveyors-university\">Land Surveyors University</a>, it all works out just peachy.</li>\n<li><strong>Failing to separate your business accounts and personal accounts.</strong> You've got to separate the two- it is necessary. Companies that do not do this are not only building a disjointed and confusing brand experience, they're ultimately not making the most of their company's online presence. Public business accounts can return results in search engines and publish content tailored specifically to customers and prospects. Furthermore, they make for a clean, forward-facing and identifiable social media presence for your business.</li>\n<li><strong><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/wf7MweZWTgXHOtSBPOrKsy3i*8nDFl1lZv5Te3UddagvYuI6YFlvtODV9aY1yoQQIOs1S2uyOa66oVHjcL-aSA__/engagesocialmedia.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/wf7MweZWTgXHOtSBPOrKsy3i*8nDFl1lZv5Te3UddagvYuI6YFlvtODV9aY1yoQQIOs1S2uyOa66oVHjcL-aSA__/engagesocialmedia.jpg?width=200\" class=\"align-right\"/></a>Failing to explicitly asking someone to engage with your content.</strong> As you see on LSU, you have plenty of ways to engage every piece of content on the site. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Because sharing specific types of content with others publically will gradually show the search engines the type of subjects to associate your account with. \u00a0Over time, the sharing of 'surveying related' content with the world will boost your profile or your company's profile higher and higher into the search engines for those keywords, thus helping you to smoke your competition when anyone searches for 'land surveying' in your area. \u00a0Also remember that you'll never get followers on other social media channels simply by following or liking them. \u00a0You have to have content being shared on your profile for anyone to ever actually find you.\u00a0 If you want someone to like, comment, retweet, or watch, just ask.</li>\n<li><strong>Failing to Include a picture.</strong> This should actually be number one and it seems basic, but when your account shows up without a photo or profile image on a social network, it looks and will be seen as <span>abandoned</span> and <span>unofficial</span>. In fact, you might as well not been there at all. \u00a0Are you invisible? \u00a0Is your company closed for business? \u00a0Social media is designed to be personal and engaging, so including a profile picture, whether of a person or a logo, will automatically give your profile some life and legs. If you don't believe me,\u00a0<a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5811/Twitter-Accounts-with-a-Profile-Picture-Have-10-Times-More-Followers-Than-Those-Without.aspx\" title=\"Twitter accounts with a picture\">Twitter accounts with a picture</a>\u00a0have 10 times more followers than those without one. Now imagine you posted some really helpful information or surveying tutorial onthe network and it managed to make it to the top search result on Google (and it happens often), then someone in search of your services finds the post and wants to contact you to do business, but you have no professional image for your profile. \u00a0Its very simple to understand why they might continue searching for a surveyor who cares about their business or \u00a0more importantly, details.<em><br/></em></li>\n<li><strong>Failing to have a blog subscription and RSS feed set up.</strong> If you're putting out helpful content and useful information, why wouldn't you offer your readers or stumblers an easy way to subscribe and be notified whenever you post something new? A subscription field on your blog is an easy way to build an opt-in database for lead nurturing, and an RSS feed will get you repeat visitors to your site that will help build your blog a loyal following. \u00a0Land Surveyors United is not a blog, it is a social network which has been retrofitted into a social support system, so offering a simple subscription form isn't quite appropriate. Instead, <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blogs/back-of-curb-digest-best-of-week-2000-surveyors-strong\">we publish a digest</a>.\u00a0 Nevertheless, if you have a blog that you maintain about surveying or your life as a surveyor, you can easily import your blog's RSS feed into your profile page using the RSS module.</li>\n<li><strong>Failing to place social media follow and share buttons on your website.</strong> What's the point in writing or publishing something if you do not offer a way to share it? Share buttons for all the social media accounts you use regularly should ALWAYS be included on your homepage and next to every piece of content you submit or write, especially your blog. For example, every single solitary piece of content on Land Surveyors United includes buttons to simply Like, Send to a friend, Share on Linkedin or Tweet the content so that your followers gradually gain a better idea about you or your company. It may seem trivial, but \u00a0the simple act of sharing something you even marginally appreciate \u00a0increases the chances of your profile showing up in search engines for \u00a0the things that matter to you. \u00a0In the short term, sharing the \u00a0content you appreciate will gain you \u00a0more followers who are \u00a0interested in the exact same things you are, because they found you in search. Share and be shared.<img src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/OLz0*rayYdnV77DpHrpyLIJLvtWNhVmxNZCLqj0i2jMInCEw2pwW-g-Khp40uYj9ui7wPyrvYesPFdyqwTenxQ__/sharesurveyingcontent.jpg\" alt=\"social media sharing surveying content\" name=\"img-1321648543724\" class=\"alignCenter\" id=\"img-1321648543724\"/></li>\n<li><strong>Failing to include links in your tweets.</strong> What if you shared something and then someone Retweeted it, but you forgot to place a link in there somewhere? You wasted your time. A retweet is great, but a click is better. If you don't include links in your tweets, you're not driving new traffic to your site with your social media reach..You might say \"But I only get 140 characters and that's not enough for links.\" \u00a0To that I say \"Shorten It.\" On Land Surveyors United, every Facebook Like, Tweet Google +1 etc. automatically shortens the link to the content for you when it goes out, creating a link back to the content. \u00a0Write a post and drop a link to your website in the end, then tweet it and watch people come to your website via the link on the post which was linked back to from the tweet. Its magically easy to build your reputation online like that. TIP: When you update your status from the home page or your profile, drop a long link in there and it will ask you if you want to shorten it...it will do this for you.\u00a0 For best results <span>\u00a0</span><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://danzarrella.com/new-twitter-data-optimal-link-placement-for-clicks.html\" title=\"highest click through rate\"></a>, place your link 25% of the way into your tweet.<br/> <strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Failing to post updates with context.</strong> I hate to have to single anyone out, but I must for the sake of this point. \u00a0You may know of or are following our good friends at Lacy Surveying<a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/i69ktbOFMFPFCf-uU*81OBGOv-GYn78GhJS-9iHdGVO8F5bOsEHoabjbXGAFFNcG9g2b55RLHgs36bTMgVVwdw__/lacysurveying.jpg\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/i69ktbOFMFPFCf-uU*81OBGOv-GYn78GhJS-9iHdGVO8F5bOsEHoabjbXGAFFNcG9g2b55RLHgs36bTMgVVwdw__/lacysurveying.jpg\" class=\"align-right\"/></a> which just so happens to have the most followers of any surveying firm online. \u00a0Now considering the fact that \u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/lacysurveying\">@lacysurveying</a> has 25,809 followers presently, but only 40 tweets and NOT ONE of them are actually about surveying. \u00a0Imagine if they had helpful surveying related content rolling through their profile. \u00a0They'd conquer the world! \u00a0How did they get that many followers? \u00a0Perhaps they played the number 3 above correctly or maybe used some secret software to increase it. \u00a0Who knows! \u00a0The point is I've been on twitter since week one, but never came across their profile until recently because there is absolutely nothing about surveying in there and their last tweet was December of last year. \u00a0Instead of just throwing up a link to a blog post, include some commentary describing what's interesting about it. Studies have found that lengthy status updates show higher interaction rates than shorter ones, measuring from 1 to 450 characters and seeing higher interaction rates the higher the character count. Other studies have shown similar findings on Twitter, where the\u00a0<a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/26127/Longer-Tweets-Generate-More-Clicks-on-Twitter-New-Data.aspx\" title=\"most clicks were received\">most clicks were received</a>\u00a0on tweets up to 130 characters.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>\u00a011. \u00a0 \u00a0 Set up a Google+ Page if you havent:</strong> Imagine if you were one of the first to set up a profile on Facebook. You'd have so much more head-start than anyone else in the industry! \u00a0 If you haven't\u00a0<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/pages/create\" title=\"set up a Google+ business page\">set up a Google+ business page</a>\u00a0yet, you're missing out on\u00a0 great opportunity to get in on a new social network in its infancy. Even better, the engagement with that page effects your search engine rankings, unlike Facebook. \u00a0Unlike companies with thousands of followers on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn, most of the Google+ landscape is ripe for the picking. Be the first in your industry to stake a claim instead of playing catch up later on. \u00a0Join in on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/101859867657440745231/\">Land Surveyors United Goog+ page</a> and share something interesting.</p>\n<h3>Who Has the Highest Klout in the Surveying Industry?</h3>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://klout.com/#/epalmetto/\"><img width=\"350\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/U0MY*oaRwaG7jt3vNx-X61X9x7EFpCM6if7HZkZCnferjPe2mmYMuyzcsExpdmd*kLwoKJmZiNFcrnolpDtg-Q__/kloutlandsurveyors.jpg?width=350\" class=\"align-right\"/></a>If you had to guess who has the highest Klout in the surveying industry, would you guess maybe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://klout.com/#/user/Topcon_News\">Topcon</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://klout.com/#/user/trimblenews\">Trimble</a>? Well you'd be wrong. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://klout.com/#/epalmetto\">Land Surveyors United</a>\u00a0(originally set up as ePalmetto back in 2007) actually has the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://klout.com/#/epalmetto/kloutstyle\">highest measurable influence</a> on the web according to Klout. If you can find one higher please let me know. I only say this because following and engaging with LSU on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/101859867657440745231/\">Google+</a> , <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/epalmetto\">twitter</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://facebook.com/landsurveyorsunited\">facebook</a> will actually do wonders for your social media influence. We always return the favor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't be embarrassed if you're failing at one of the above. \u00a0Its a learning process and if you're making any of these social media mistakes, shhh...we won't tell anybody about it...as long as you promise to go fix it. These are simple mistakes to make, but luckily, they are also super easy to remedy. And whether you have a weak\u00a0 social media strategy or a robust one, fixing these social media mistakes is a guaranteed way to supplement your efforts. \u00a0 I took this time to explain this to you because no one else in this industry will. \u00a0Everyone other than Land Surveyors United seems to be so preoccupied with racing to the top that they couldn't care less if you were there with them. \u00a0I want ALL surveying companies to be at the top of search engines in thier area, so please do not hesitate to ask any questions you might have and i'll do my best to point you in the right direction. \u00a0Good Luck out There!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000;

What market you will be in, such as title surveys. Call around to some of your competitors to see what they are charging for the same service. I have had many of those \"just pricing\" calls over the years and there is nothing wrong with it. When you have no idea where to start, they are your best bet to get a feel of what the market is doing in your area. Choose a few companies that are reputable and not considered a fly by night. Then decide what price is best for you. Take in consideration your operating cost and percentage of profit you would like to see out of each survey. Look at other companies websites.

My company owns a GPS unit now, but I have done the rental deal in the past, it is a viable option.</p>\n<p>The best drafting software for me is AutoCAD only because this is what I've \"grown up\" with in this profession. I have also used TraversePC and do like what it brings to the table, but it is difficult to remove yourself from the ACAD mindset and I just wind up getting frustrated not being able to navigate through it fast enough. The cost, however, is significantly different. ACAD is absolutely out of their minds charging something like $7500 a seat for Civil3D, don't quote me on that, and TraversePC runs at most $2000 for the full blown version and always are running sales for 1/2 price and it does everything ACAD can do.</p>\n<p>I am not in the ownership role at this present time, but I run a surveying department for a small firm that has decreased in size from 3 crews and a full office staff, to just myself, a civil engineer, and a secretary.

Often however there is not much you can do with it in those\u00a0environments. A robotic total station may not be a particularly good idea in a big city or suburban setting because of theft issues.

Mr. Smith\u2019s Deed was pulled and it appeared that he had purchased the subject property under a Warranty Deed from Mr. Sparkle (seller) in 2007. It contained a written description of the subject property signed and sealed by Mr. Jake Leg, PLS. It also contained a stamp to return it to a prominent Title Insurance firm so Mr. Smith was questioned to see if he could produce a copy of a Title Policy. Mr. Smith could not produce a copy of the Title Policy and under further questioning it became apparent that Mr. Smith had probably purchased a lender policy only. I told him to contact his lender to see if he could obtain a copy of it.</p>\n<p>The alley formed the southerly portion of the subject property. The surveyed description by Mr. Jake Leg mentioned the alley as it passed along its southerly boundary but contained no information on the instrument that would have abandoned it. After the initial field visit it appeared that Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones were fighting over the south \u00bd of the alley that was contained in Mr. Smith\u2019s Deed. Mr. Smith was north of Mr. Jones and the old alley was between them. Mr. Jones had built a fence down the middle of the old alley which prompted Mr. Smith to call me.</p>\n<p>Mr. Jones\u2019 Deed was pulled and it made no mention of the alley but was for the fractional Lots adjoining the alley to the south. A partial chain of title was pulled for Mr. Jones going back 2 transactions dating to the early 70s. The alley was never mentioned in any of them. The current tax map showed Mr. Smith owning the entire alley. At first blush it appeared that Mr. Smith may have some merit to his complaints about Mr. Jones.</p>\n<p>Mr. Jones was interviewed to see if he might have any documents that could shed light on this problem. Although Mr. Jones would produce no documents he insisted that he was the owner of the south \u00bd of the alley. He complained bitterly that he could no longer access his parking lot behind his building without use of the alley.</p>\n<p>It seemed unusual for the entire alley to end up in the hands of one party but not impossible. In a typical reversion \u00bd of the alley would go to the south adjoiner and \u00bd of the alley would go to the north adjoiner. However if Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones\u2019 title had merged in the past when the alley was abandoned this condition was certainly not beyond reason.</p>\n<p>I partial chain of title was pulled on Mr. Smith to see if the instrument abandoning the alley could be located and to find out if a title merge with Mr. Jones could be found. The old tax maps from 1993 were also pulled to see if it might contain any information on the alley. The results of this effort were shocking.</p>\n<p>The old tax map showed the alley still being owned by the City. The partial chain of title for Mr. Smith dated to 1984 through 2 transactions. The northerly fractional Lots were mentioned but not the alley in the 1984 transaction. The next transaction in 1994 contained descriptions for 2 parcels. The first being the northerly fractional Lots and the second being \u201call the interest I may have in the alley south of the first parcel.\u201d This description was conveyed to Mr. Sparkle (seller) who sold the subject parcel to Mr. Smith in 2007. However the conveyance to Mr. Smith had changed again from the 1984 description and the 1994 description and now described the northerly fractional Lots and the alley as a single property. None of these descriptions mentioned the instrument abandoning the alley. They did contain information that suggested that no merge of title between the properties on either side of the alley had ever occurred at anytime in history.<br/> <br/> This prompted a search for the instrument abandoning the alley in the public records with no results.</p>\n<p>I called Mr. Smith and told him that it may be necessary to hire an abstractor to track down the alley abandonment instrument. I told him it seemed highly unlikely that his predecessor in title could have obtained the entire alley in a reversion. Mr. Smith told me he had a box of old papers he found in a building on the property when he purchased it. He said I could come down and look at them if I wanted to.</p>\n<p>The box Mr. Smith had contained copies of surveys, copies of Deeds and copies of lease agreements for his property and Mr. Jones\u2019 property stretching back more than 60 years. In the box was a copy of the alley abandonment instrument. The instrument dated 1958 stated that the City quit claimed the alley to \u201cthe abutting land owners as their interest appeared.\u201d</p>\n<p>This was a typical reversion as I had suspected and indicated that Mr. Jones was correct and in fact did own \u00bd the alley. This implied that the description for the subject tract going into the seller of the property to Mr. Smith had been interpreted incorrectly when the property was sold to Mr. Smith. Either Mr. Jake Leg, PLS or the Title Insurance firm had taken the wording \u201call the interest I may have in the alley south of the first parcel\u201d to mean \u201cthe entire alley\u201d in the description into the seller. Thus Mr. Jake Leg, PLS had written a new description that encompassed the entire alley for the sale of the property to Mr. Smith.</p>\n<p>The seller of the subject property never owned the south \u00bd of the alley they sold to Mr. Smith. The south \u00bd of the alley was worth 30 thousand dollars. I prepared the survey along with an attached Surveyor\u2019s report and sat down with Mr. Smith to explain the results. He was angry and upset when I told him that his neighbor Mr. Jones was correct and how this problem had occurred. I told him that he had a good chance of recovering the money he had paid for the south \u00bd of the alley however. This seemed to make him feel a little better. I gave him the number of a good real property lawyer that I know.</p>\n<p>Mr. Jones sued the seller who in turn sued the Title Insurance Company who in turn sued Mr. Jake Leg, RPS. Last I heard Mr. Smith had executed a Correction Deed with the seller and they had settled for some 50 thousand dollars. I do not know about the outcome of the suit by the seller against the Title Insurance Company but the Land Surveying Company Mr. Jake Leg, PLS worked for is now out of business.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(This story is completely fictional and any\u00a0resemblance\u00a0to actual events is purely a coincidence.)</p>","createdDate":"2011-09-29T14:43:49.726Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-16T02:36:22.077Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-09-29T14:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:63457","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"Mt Pleasant SC civilian killed in Afghanistan","description":"<div id=\"WNStoryHeader\"><h3><span style=\"font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;\"><a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2KNk5DEI21Q/TmisQlUhIDI/AAAAAAAAJVU/E06DUH59LOg/Will%252520Coker.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2KNk5DEI21Q/TmisQlUhIDI/AAAAAAAAJVU/E06DUH59LOg/Will%252520Coker.jpg?width=200\" width=\"200\" class=\"align-left\"/></a></span></h3>\n</div>\n<div id=\"WNStoryBody\"><p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"wnFacebookTools-Like\"><span style=\"font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"font-size-1\"><span>P</span><em class=\"wnDate\">osted:\u00a0Sep 06, 2011 2:50 PM EDT</em><em class=\"wnDate\">Updated:\u00a0Sep 06, 2011 2:50 PM EDT</em></span></span></div>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><strong>Mt Pleasant SC civilian killed in Afghanistan</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-2\">\u00a0S.C.

GPS IIF-2, renamed Space Vehicle Number 63 (SVN-63), is functioning normally and ready to begin on-orbit maneuvers and operational testing.</p>\n<p>After two postponements, the second\u00a0 GPS Block IIF satellite launched successfully from Cape Canaveral at 2:41 a.m. EDT on July 16. GPS signals from the spacecraft payload will be turned on for test purposes in the coming days</p>\n<p>The GPS IIF satellites will provide greater navigation accuracy to<br/>users through improvements in atomic clock technology and a more robust<br/>signal for commercial aviation and safety-of-life applications, known as<br/>the third civil signal (L5). \u00a0Along with new and improved signals GPS<br/>IIF will have a longer design life of 12 years, providing long-term<br/>service and reduced operating costs.

Checkout includes payload and system checks to verify operability with the GPS constellation of satellites, ground receivers, and the Operational Control Segment system.</p>\n<p>Boeing will officially turn over SVN-63 to the Air Force 50th Space Wing and the 2nd Space Operations Squadron after the spacecraft completes on-orbit checkout.

At the same time, other critics have called for holding, as the boundary corner, iron rods, pipes or other objects merely because they exist and were found somewhere near the alleged corner. They say that the mere existence of this evidence of possession, even of an unknown genesis, is enough to supersede any other evidence of the original boundary and render it irrelevant. All of this despite, and to the apparent exclusion of, other critical forms of evidence such as deed calls and matters of historical record! They make these assertions even in cases where such iron rods, pipes and other objects are in direct conflict with all other evidence found on the ground and that which is contained in the writings. These critics hold out these evidentiary elements as conclusive as to the location of boundaries of real property solely on the basis of their mere existence or past existence. Can you say \"Unwritten Rights\"?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">I find these assertions specious, appealing only to those who would rather rely on a superficial and cursory attempt to locate and evaluate evidence rather than commit themselves to an exhaustive search for the facts that would support a rational and informed conclusion.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">For the purpose of confining this discussion to a local perspective, we will examine some recent cases that reached the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court level in Texas.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">In the Supreme Court case of\u00a0<i>Minh Thu Tran v. William Macha</i>,\u00a01)\u00a0Neighboring relatives shared the use of a driveway for many years, thinking it belonged to one of them when in fact it belonged to the other. The court of appeals held this mutual mistake and mutual use transferred title by adverse possession.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The Supreme Court reversed this ruling stating that under Texas law, adverse possession requires an actual and visible appropriation of real property, commenced and continued under a claim of right that is inconsistent with and is hostile to the claim of another person. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE 16.021</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">1.\u00a0The statute requires visible appropriation; mistaken beliefs about ownership do not transfer title until someone acts on them. See, e.g.,\u00a0<i>Bywaters v. Gannon, 686 S.W.2d 593, 595 (Tex. 1985).\u00a0</i>Thus, there must be adverse possession, not just adverse beliefs. The statute requires that such possession be inconsistent with and hostile to the claims of all others. Joint use is not enough, because possession must be of such character as to indicate unmistakably an assertion of a claim of exclusive ownership in the occupant.<br/><br/><i>Rhodes v. Cahill, 802 S.W.2d 643, 645 (Tex. 1990) (quoting Rick v. Grubbs, 214 S.W.2d 925, 927 (Tex. 1948)) (emphasis in original); McDon-nold v. Weinacht, 465 S.W.2d 136, 141 (Tex. 1971).\"\u00a0</i>In this case the court of appeals held that adverse possession need not be intentional, so long as it is visible, open, and noto-rious.\u00a0<i>176 S.W.3d at 133</i>. The Supreme Court disagreed saying while It is true that hostile use does not require an intention to dispossess the rightful owner, or even know that there\u00a0is one. See Calfee v. Duke,\u00a0<i>544 S.W.2d 640, 642 (Tex. 1976).\u00a0</i>But there must be an intention to claim property as ones own to the exclusion of all others; mere occupancy of land without any intention to appropriate it will not.\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">In another recent Court of Appeals case Pauline</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>Mohnke v. Wanda Green-wood\u00a0</i>2, not only adverse possession but boundary by acquiescence were claimed among other things. It was asserted that a wire fence the 1967 survey was based on should be given preference in the order of dignity of calls because it was an artificial object and thus must be given priority over other evidence. However the Court of Appeals found, as a matter of fact, that the 1927 deed upon which the survey of 1967 relied on did not refer to the wire fence as an artificial object. The 1927 deed contained no calls for monuments, rods or artificial objects, just courses and distances. It was found in this case that the survey prepared in 1967 did not locate any rods or monuments as the basis of it\u2018s survey, that the 1967 survey set monuments or rods along the existing fence line and that the 1967 survey was a fence survey, that is, it was based on a fence line.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">On the claim of adverse possession the court found that there was no evidence presented to suggest the wire fence was anything other than a casual fence.The Court of Appeals pointed to</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>Rhodes v. Cahill, 802 S.W.2d 643, 646 (Tex. 1990); Osborn v. Deep Rock Oil Corp., 267 S.W.2d 781, 785 (Tex. 1954</i>) which said that\u00a0\"If the fence existed before the claimant took possession of the land and the claimant fails to demonstrate the purpose for which it was erected, then the fence is a casual fence.\" Further, the Appeals Court stated that according to Section 16.021 of the Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code, \"adverse possession\" means \"an actual and visible appropriation of real property, commenced and continued under a claim of right that is inconsistent with and is hostile to the claim of another person.\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. Section(s) 16.021 (Vernon 1986). A showing of adverse possession is required under both the ten and twenty-five year statutes of limitations. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. Section(s) 16.026, 16.027 (Vernon 1986) and that to establish title through adverse possession, \"the possession must be of such character as to indicate unmistakably an asser-tion of a claim of exclusive ownership in the occupant.\"\u00a0<i>Rick v. Grubbs, 214 S.W.2d 925, 927 (1948).\u00a0</i></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<span>\n</span><p><span><span class=\"font-size-3\">It was argued that the existence of the wire fence, the use of the land for grazing cattle and the planting of pine trees establish hostile possession as a matter of law. However, the Court of Appeals found these factors alone are insufficient to establish title by adverse possession unless the disputed property was \"designedly enclosed\" for the claimants use. R</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>hodes v. Cahill, 802 S.W.2d at 646; McDon-nold v. Weinacht, 465 S.W.2d 136, 142 (Tex. 1971); Osborn, 153 Tex. at 287, 267 S.W.2d at 785.\"\u00a0</i>The Court of Appeals stated that limitation statutes do not contemplate that a claimant of adverse possession can derive aid, in establishing his claim, from an enclosure casually created by third persons in effecting a different purpose of their own, and who are strangers to both the claimant of adverse possession and the true owner of the enclosed land. In such a case, the enclosure, so far as our limitation statutes are concerned, has no more effect than if same had never come into existence. It is thus well settled that the mere grazing of land incidentally en closed by a fence created by others cannot support a claim of adverse possession.\u00a0<i>McDonnold, 465 S.W.2d at 142; Kahanek, 121 S.W.2d at 331.\"</i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>\u00a0</i></span></p>\n<p style=\"display: inline !important;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><i>Finally as to the claim of boundary by acquiescence in this Court of Appeals case the court said In order to establish a boundary by acquiescence; the claimant had to show that the location of the fence was agreed to as a result of a disagreement between the landowners over the boundary line of their respective properties. \"The existence of uncertainty, doubt or dispute is essential to the validity of such [an] agreement.\"\u00a0</i></span></p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><i>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Marathon Oil Co., 152 S.W.2d 711, 714 (Tex. 1941); McAllister v. Samuels, 857 S.W.2d at 778\u00a0</i>(holding that without uncertainty as to the true boundary line there can be no boundary by acquiescence). In this case no such evidence of the existence of any of these matters was presented by the claimant other than the fence itself. The Court of Appeals went on, adding \"When there is no doubt as to the true location of the boundary, mere proof of acquiescence in an erroneous line will not support a finding of boundary by agreement.\u00a0<i>Wall v. Car-rell, 894 S.W.2d at 798</i>, citing\u00a0<i>Kirby Lumber Corp. v. Lindsay, 455 S.W.2d 733 (Tex. 1970).\" \u00a0</i></span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The claimant in this case appeared to argue that, because the conflict in\u00a0surveys performed in 1967 and a later survey that delineated different boundary lines, the \"uncertainty, doubt or dispute\" element is satisfied. The Court of Appeals stated that it is fundamental that the doubt or uncertainty must be known to the landowners at the time they agree to the boundary. See, e.g.,\u00a0<i>Kirby, 455 S.W.2d at 738-39; Gulf, 152 S.W.2d at 714; McAllister, 857 S.W.2d at 778.\"\u00a0</i>The court also said that \"A review of the record reveals no evidence of a misunderstanding or uncertainty as to the true boundary between the adjacent property owners. Without such a dispute, there can be no boundary by acquiescence.\"</span><p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It is worth noting that in this Court of Appeals case, payment of attorney\u2018s fees by the claimant was upheld.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">A very recent case before the Court of Appeals,</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><i>Moore v. Stone\u00a0</i>3)\u00a0<i>,\u00a0</i>explored another claim of adverse possession and boundary by acquiescence under the 3, 5, 10 and 25 year statutes. This case involved a fence constructed some 50 years prior.</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0In this case the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the lower court who had ruled in favor of the claimant. The Court of Appeals found that there was no evidence presented to suggest for what purpose the fence in question was constructed.</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The Court of Appeals pointed to the fact that the Texas Supreme Court has said, \"It is well settled that when one enters into possession of land under a deed, his possession is referable to the deed, and it is presumed to be in conformity with it, and is confined to the limits thereof.\u00a0<i>Harmon v. Overton Ref. Co., 109 S.W. 2d 457, 460</i>, rev\u2018d order of rendition on rehr\u2018g in\u00a0<i>110 S.W. 2d 555 (Tex. 1937).\"\u00a0</i>The Court of Appeals went on to state To claim adjoining land outside the limits of the described boundaries, the possessor must have actual possession of such additional land of such a character as of itself will give notice of an actual adverse possession.<i>Southern Pine Lumber Co. v. Hart, 340 S.W.2d 775, 781 n. 2 (Tex. 1960); Osborn v. Deep Rock Oil Co., 153 Tex. 281, 267 S.W. 2d 781 (1954).\u00a0</i></span></p>\n<span class=\"font-size-3\">Thus, to have title or color of title, the deeds of claimant had to include the disputed property within its descriptions. The claimant had stipulated that their deed called for a creek and not the fence as the boundary and since the claimant necessarily admitted that their deeds did not include the disputed property, there was no evidence that claimant had title or color of title that would allow the submission of questions to the jury regarding the 3 year statute of limitations on adverse possession. The Court found the same was true of a claim under the 5 and 25 year statutes. The Court also found that as a matter of fact there was no evidence presented to support a claim of adverse possession under the 10 year statute either because such a claimant must demonstrate that the disputed land was held in peaceable and adverse possession and cultivates, uses, or enjoys the property.\n</span>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">As to the claim of boundary by acquiescence the Court of Appeals again reiterated that a boundary by acquiescence must stem from uncertainty, doubt or dispute. They concluded that there was no evidence presented in this case to suggest any of these elements existed to support the contention that such an agreement of this nature had taken place.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">The Court of Appeals also said \"Although acquiescence and recognition may be evidence of an agreement fixing a boundary and may support an inference or presumption that there has been such an agreement, this presumption will not apply when induced by mistake, or when the true boundary is established conclusively by undisputed evidence.\u00a0<i>Kirby Lumber Corp. v. Lindsey, 455 S.W.2d 733 (Tex. 1970); Wall, 894 S.W.2d at 798.\u00a0</i>Further, when there is no doubt as to the true location of the boundary line, mere proof of acquiescence in an erroneous line will not support a finding that such other line is the true line.\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">Allow me to quote Mr. W. A. Rounds, former Chief Engineer of the Continental Oil Company\u00a04)\u00a0<i>\"The Surveyor has been subject to bitter condemnation accruing from his findings in the field. Yet, as a professional man, he is required to\u00a0</i>report such findings regardless of the ultimate outcome. When the public recognizes the dual requirements of the surveyor\u2019s work, in that first, he must locate the property as it is occupied; and second, he must locate the property according to the record title; a great improvement will be shown in land surveying. The location of occupancy requires the application of the mechanics of surveying, while the retracing of the record title requires not only coordination with the General Land Office, but much more work afield to obtain control.\"\u00a0</span>Some things never change.</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>\u00a0</i></span>\n</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\">In closing, merely because irons rods, pipes and other objects exist and can be found, apparently set by surveyors subsequent to the original surveyor, such irons rods, pipes and other objects are not necessarily proof of the location of an original boundary or any other boundary. They are only evidence of the subsequent surveyor\u2018s opinion as to the location of a boundary. Similarly, a fence is not proof of a boundary by adverse possession or a boundary by acquiescence solely because it existed or exists. I am not suggesting that such evidence can\u2018t be used to determine a boundary. What I am suggesting is that relevancy of this evidence to the boundary in question must be demonstrated, and, what is more, proven!</span><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>\u00a0</i></span></p>\n<span class=\"font-size-3\">\n<i>\n</i></span><p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>Come Ahead!\u00a0<br/><br/>\u00a0</i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>\u00a0</i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>Citations:</i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>(1)<a href=\"http://www.tsps.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t81\">http://www.tsps.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t81</a></i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>\u00a0</i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>(2)<a href=\"http://www.jurisimprudence.com/\">http://www.jurisimprudence.com/</a>!Docments&amp;Research/Research/Adverse%20Possession/Mohnke%20v.%20Greenwood,%20No.%2014-94-01032-CV%20(Tex.App.%20Dist.14%20(Casual%20fence).txt</i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>\u00a0</i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>(3)<a href=\"http://www.10thcoa.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/HTMLopinion.asp?OpinionID50\">http://www.10thcoa.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/HTMLopinion.asp?OpinionID50</a></i></span></p>\n<span class=\"font-size-3\"><i><br/></i><i>\n</i></span><p style=\"display: inline !important;\"><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i>\u00a0</i></span></p>\n<i>\n</i><p style=\"display: inline !important;\"><i>(4)Texas Surveyors Association Short Course Reports (2nd Edition)</i></p>\n<i>\n</i><p style=\"display: inline !important;\"><i>\u00a0</i></p>\n<i>\n</i><p><i>Bulletin of the Agricultural and Mechanical Col-lege of Texas, Fourth Series, Vol. 12, January 1, 1941, No. 1 \"Some Judicial Decisions affecting Property lines\"</i></p>\n<i>\n</i><p><i>\u00a0</i></p>\n<i>\n</i><p><i>\u00a0</i></p>\n<p><i>\u00a0</i></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><i><br/></i></span></p>\n<i>\n</i><p><i>\u00a0</i></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i><br/></i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i><br/></i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><i><br/></i></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><br/></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-3\"><br/></span></p>","createdDate":"2011-07-11T04:51:23.251Z","updatedDate":"2017-07-10T17:11:29.904Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-07-11T04:51:23.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:50770","contributorName":"3i7uq8ojnbaej","description":"<p>Karl, I agree completely. \u00a0I have learned to not believe everything that I think unless/until I can prove it to myself. \u00a0If I can not prove something to myself, then naturally, It would be dishonest to attempt to prove it to somebody else. \u00a0Sometimes, the less we know the more we believe. \u00a0I like to get to know all the available evidence before I can believe in my own conclusion (professional opinion). \u00a0Anything less would be an unprofessional assumption. \u00a0</p>\n<p>-Scott D.

This particular client had ordered some small subdivisions in the past but they were redeveloping this existing fractional lot and building an expensive custom home on it. Many of the parcels within this particular subdivision were being redeveloped and the neighborhood had completely changed character over the last few years. The lots in this subdivision were typical City lots and were indicated on the subdivision map to be 50 feet wide and 100 feet deep. These particular lots in Block 6 of the subdivision were numbered 1 through 10 with Lot 1 on the Northeast corner of the Block and Lot 10 on the Southeast corner of the Block. Lot 1 through 10 was bounded on the East side by a street and on the West side by other lots in the Block numbered 11 through 20.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The subject description was for the South 47 feet of Lot 5 Block 6 and did not appear to be much of a challenge. I dispatched a field crew and they returned with some pretty good evidence including some block corners. Nothing seemed amiss and in the initial analysis the boundaries of the subject parcel seemed certain. There was an unusual condition however in that the old fence along the South boundary of the subject tract was 3 feet too far to the South, in addition there were old iron rods at that fence apparently set in the past by previous surveyors. The South adjoiner was an old day care center that had occupied the land for many years. It appeared at first blush that we may have a 3 foot gap along our Southern boundary.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border-style: initial; border-color: initial;\" width=\"450\" alt=\"The Gap that Swallowed the Land Surveyor\" src=\"http://api.ning.com:80/files/CoZ2vGrqRzO92GHnpVRUEUr1xmDwrCh5Nl3vS0cWeTH4JWBQQ2vD9Em1gxqq9fCAxkS8cdgvZxoa5CKN6G26kg__/H01189003.jpg?width=450\"/></p>\n<p>The North adjoiner had a custom home being constructed on it at the time of the initial field visit. The new foundation was 3 feet North of the subject tract boundary which would be a typical side setback for new construction in this particular City. An old pinch top pipe and a new capped iron rod set by the surveyor of the North adjoiner were found marking the subject tract\u2019s North boundary. Framing crews were busy working on the new home adjoining the subject tract to the North when my field crew left the site.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I began comparing the field evidence with the records and as a matter of course the current North and South adjoining descriptions were pulled and the chain of title for the subject tract researched by me in preparation of completing the survey.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A very interesting history of the subject tract began to emerge. The original developer of the subdivision, that this fractional lot was part of, had been unable to sell the parcels of land as the original subdivision map indicated. The original developer had instead, for one reason or another, sold fractional pieces of lots, either combining fractions of lots or only selling a fraction of lot. The developer did this piecemeal throughout the subdivision until the subdivision was fully developed. During the 80s this area had experienced an economic downturn and a single real estate speculator had managed to acquire many of these parcels within this subdivision. At one time this real estate speculator apparently owned all of the lots within the block the subject tract was part of. The real estate speculator was now selling different fractional pieces of these lots within this subdivision to developers, with different fractional descriptions than the original descriptions he had acquired these lands under. The original description the real estate speculator had acquired the subject tract under had been the South 47 feet of Lot 5 Block 6 and the adjoining (to the south) North 3 feet of Lot 6 Block 6. However when the real estate speculator conveyed the subject tract to my client (the custom home builder) he only conveyed the South 47 feet of Lot 5 Block 6.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This seemed to explain the discrepancy with the old fence and stakes being 3 feet too far to the South of the subject tract boundary. The South adjoining description (old day care center) was for all of Lot 6 Block 6. This description was recently conveyed to the day care center occupying this land for many years. Previously the day care had leased the land from the real estate speculator who conveyed them the land. The chain of title was traced a little further and the original description that the real estate speculator had acquired the land under in the 80s was for the South 47 feet of Lot 6 Block 6 only.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was no doubt that the South adjoiner had been staked out according to the original description sometime in the past and when it was recently conveyed by the real estate speculator to the day care center it was never surveyed with the new description so there were no new stakes marking its new boundary which had now shifted 3 feet to the North of the original description the real estate speculator had acquired the land under. Even though there was no problem with the descriptions or the location of the boundaries in those conveyances I made a note to call my client and recommend that this problem be cleared up. It just looked odd on the ground with the fence being 3 feet South of the new boundary.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I turned my attention to the North boundary of the subject tract which appeared to be nothing more than an exercise in prudence given the field evidence found (capped iron rod recently set and the old pinch top pipe marking the subject tract North boundary). I was horrified when I examined the most recent description for the conveyance of the tract adjoining us to the North. This description was for the South 47 feet of Lot 4 Block 6. There was no mention of what happened to the North 3 feet of Lot 5 Block 6 as the description for the subject tract was for the South 47 feet of Lot 5 Block 6.</p>\n<p>It became apparent that the surveyor who had surveyed the tract adjoining us to the North had staked his boundary 3 feet too far to the South (as evidenced by the capped iron rod he had set and the new foundation that was being built exactly on the South boundary for that conveyance description). There should have been a 3 foot gap between the subject tract boundary and the boundary of the tract to the North of us according to the recent conveyance descriptions. My first thought was that this problem was of no concern to me as it did not affect the subject tract\u2019s North boundary which I was surveying. I thought I might be able to get away with a courtesy call to the surveyor of the adjoiner to the North and that would be the end of it.</p>\n<p>This hope evaporated when I realized that the person who was developing the adjoining tract to the North was also my client according to the most recent conveyance. There was some comfort in the fact that the subject tract, the South adjoiner and the North adjoiner all had a common grantor which was the real estate speculator however I felt obligated to inform my client of this problem if what I had uncovered turned out to be true. I quickly called the surveyor of the adjoining parcel to the North and sent him the half drafted survey I was working on via email. I asked this surveyor to look at what I was seeing and tell me where I had gone wrong.</p>\n<p>I did not immediately here back from him that day and I began to become extremely anxious thinking about the construction my client was engaging in on the adjoining tract to the North. The new structure on the North adjoner would not meet the setback line requirements and the boundary had been staked out 3 feet too far to the South. I felt I had to call my client as soon as possible or face possible ethics questions regarding my behavior. I decided to wait until the next morning to give the other surveyor time to respond. After all the other surveyor might be able to shed some light on this problem that would prove my concerns were groundless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I was very relieved to receive a phone call early the next day from the other surveyor. He confirmed what I had on my preliminary survey I had sent him and stated that he had simply made a mistake. The other surveyor sent me a copy of a corrected survey that he was also planning to send to our common client. The other surveyor had found the pinch top pipe along the subject tract\u2019s North boundary and assumed it was the South boundary of his tract and had proceeded to stake his tract out, 3 feet too far to the South. This did not seem too big of a problem since the real estate speculator apparently owned all the land in question. It seemed merely a problem of filing a correction deed that would include the North 3 feet of Lot 5 Block 6 from the real estate speculator to my client.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I called my client explained the problems along the North and South Boundaries of the subject tract. I told him that there were no problems with the subject tract boundary I was surveying. I thought we just had some hickeys that needed to be fixed. It seemed a matter of a couple of three correction deeds between himself, the real estate speculator and the South adjoner and the problems would be solved.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few days went by and I was contacted to modify my survey of the subject tract to reflect a correction deed filed to convey the North 3 feet of Lot 6 Block 6 to my client from the real estate speculator and was also provided a correction deed, filed a day before that conveyance, between the day care center and the real estate speculator for the same parcel. I thought everything was in order and was relieved that the parties involved in the problem on the South boundary of the subject tract had followed my advice. I felt certain that the 3 foot gap along the North boundary of the subject tract could be fixed the same way with little or no damage to anyone including the surveyor who had made the embarrassing mistake in staking out the parcel adjoining the subject tract to the North.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks or so went by and I received a phone call from my client who was in a panic. The real estate speculator had refused to execute a correction deed to him for the North 3 feet of Lot 5 Block 6 because the real estate speculator said he did not own it. I had not looked at a chain of title for the North adjoiner to the subject tract because it was of no concern to me and I had a copy of the last conveyance. The North boundary of the subject tract had no conflicts and I had followed the subject tract chain of title back to the first conveyance. I was uncertain how to advise my client so I told him I would look in to it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>My client was very worried because he had a large sum of money tied up in the home he was constructing on the tract adjoining the subject tract to the North. He would complete the construction within the next week on the adjoining tract to the North and needed to sell it to recoup his investment. If he did not manage to sell the home (because it now did not meet the side yard setback requirements of the City) as soon as the construction was completed he would be wiped out. He told me any delay would place him in serious financial difficulty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I went back to the Courthouse and traced the chain of title for the North adjoiner. I was shocked to find that no conveyance had been made by the original subdivision developer for the North 3 feet of Lot 5 Block 6. I went to the tax office and found in the old paper tax map records that the 3 foot wide sliver in question consisting of the North 3 feet of Lot 5 Block 6 was still in the name of the original subdivision developer. The subdivision developer had not paid taxes on the sliver since the 1940s but when the old paper tax maps had been digitized the tax office simply did not show the 3 foot strip\u00a0on the new electronic version of the tax maps. The original subdivision developer was almost 70 years in default on the taxes to this sliver. The County and City had never done anything about it over the years, like selling this sliver at a tax sale, but had continued to carry the original subdivision developer on the tax roles as the owner. This long unpaid tax bill had reached an astronomical amount of 12 thousand dollars.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I called my client back and explained what I had found. I advised him to do one of three things.</p>\n<p>1) Approach the taxing authority and explain to them that you wish to pay the back taxes and ask them to issue a tax deed for it.</p>\n<p>2) Approach the taxing authority and force a tax sale of the tract and then buy it at the tax sale.</p>\n<p>3) Since the real estate speculator had been the owner of the tracts on both sides of this 3 foot strip since the 80s have him file an affidavit of ownership by possession and then convey them a quick claim deed to the land in question. Begin paying current taxes on it and then land should be able to be insured by a title insurance firm within 5 years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>My client was furious. He was now on the verge of completing the construction of this house and had potential buyers looking at it but the title insurance firm had told him they could not insure the property or the improvements because of this problem. He was going to be financially ruined by a delay of any potential sale of this property. He complained that the surveyor who had surveyed the property carried no liability insurance and that he had no way to recover any damages from the surveyor for the erroneous survey. He did not want to pay the extra 12 thousand dollars for land he felt he already had purchased according to the survey that had been performed. He was afraid to force a tax sale because if somebody else outbid him for this sliver of land he would be over a barrel and be forced to pay an even higher price for it. He could not wait 5 years to get the property insured and needed to sell it now to keep himself financially solvent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He asked me if there was any chance he could get another surveyor to survey the property and make the same mistake the first surveyor had. He could then take that \u201cnew\u201d wrong survey to a \u201cnew\u201d title insurance firm and pass the problem on to the new purchaser. I told him that the problem would not be passed on to the new purchaser in his scenario but would in fact set him up for a potential lawsuit. I advised him not to try what he suggesting and pointed out that his conversation with me created a huge liability for him in me if such a lawsuit were to take place in the future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>My client ended up approaching the taxing authority and purchasing the sliver for the 12 thousand dollars in back taxes. He pursued an action against the other surveyor and from what I understand was able to get a settlement out of him for the damages caused by his erroneous survey.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last I heard the other surveyor has now placed his surveying business up for sale.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>","createdDate":"2011-07-03T15:08:54.855Z","updatedDate":"2018-09-13T17:13:38.183Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-07-03T15:00:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:45311","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"Land Surveying Related Patents","description":"<p>Searching google patents for <strong>\"land surveying</strong>\" can be an interesting adventure. \u00a0You'll find that there have been so many great ideas over the years by <strong>land surveyors</strong> hoping to change the way they work, get better results or just invent something the world has never seen before. \u00a0Below are a few of the more interesting land surveying related patents that I found.</p>\n<h3>Remote controlled land surveying assistance device for path response\u00a0</h3>\n<h4><span class=\"addmd\">James B.

Besides, a grave injustice would be done many readers if I failed to comment on the anomalous position which the abstracter and the owner of the abstract plan and business find themselves today.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since about 1908, the abstract business has been engaged in a vigorous, sometimes bitter competition with title insurance. To many this has seemed a struggle for survival. In more populous counties such as Bexar, Dallas and Harris, and possibly Tarrant, title insurance has largely prevailed. In at least three of those counties it is estimated that about 95% of the real estate transactions closed on any title evidence are closed under the protection of title insurance.\" .........</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>......\"To complicate the problem of the abstract plant owner and the abstracter-agent, we find ourselves well in the midst of a movement by lawyers to enter the filed of title insurance, both at the level of the abstracter-agent, and that of the underwriter, even before the transition from the abstract business to the title insurance is fully accomplished. But that complication is one beyond the scope of this book.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Frank A.

The intention must be derived by examining the transaction document's words and what was actually done in respect to that document. Regarding the land's location, the words and phrases must be analyzed and weighted in the light of the times the description was written. This does not call for a creative imagination. No words should be added and none subtracted. In livingston Oil &amp; Gas Co. v.

She and her husband lived out of state and had purchased the lot in question at a tax auction some four years earlier. They had purchased the land speculating that they could sell it sometime in the future at a profit.They had viewed the land prior to their purchase and she told me that they were under the impression that there was a small old house on it. They assumed the land and house they had looked at was the land they had purchased in the auction although they had not had a land survey performed.Her husband had passed through my town in the last month or so and had been out to what they thought was their property. Her husband had been surprised to find a new home on the land with people occupying it. The people occupying the lot told him to get off their land and refused to speak with him about the property.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I urged this woman to get in contact with the people occupying the land and exchange information on the property in question. A contract between us was executed and I started work on this project.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lot in question was in an old subdivision from the 30s that I was somewhat familiar with. The subdivision was composed of deep narrow lots with blocks over a thousand feet wide measured in an east-west direction. Some of the streets dividing these blocks had never been opened. Other streets had been opened through the blocks within this subdivision from adjoining subdivisions with the lots being sold to the city for street purposes. I began examining the old subdivision map and at first glance it appeared to show all the lots at the same width in an east-west direction. However, upon further review the old recorded subdivision map had very small dimensions at the extreme north boundary and the extreme south boundary of the subdivision which indicated that the lots were all of varying widths between 60 and 70 feet measured in an east-west direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I could not imagine that somebody would have built a new home on the wrong lot but determining the location of the land in question would be a little harder than I had first thought. A field crew was dispatched and they spoke with the people occupying the land in question as they were gathering evidence. The people occupying the land agreed to let my field crew access the property for the purpose of the survey.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The initial review of the field evidence was inconclusive but strongly began to suggest that the people who had the new home had built it on my client\u2018s lot. I began to pull the records for a chain of title on the lot in question and the adjoining lots to see if this would shed some light on the problem. In the meantime I sent the field crew back armed with a preliminary mathematical projection of what I thought the subdivision should look like based on the initial field data. Deliberate searches were then performed at the block corners and lot corners within the block in question and surrounding blocks to find more evidence.The field crew was finding some monuments at the search locations so I went out to the site to look at the evidence myself. I was out in the field when I received a phone call from my client. She said that she had obtained a copy of a survey from the people occupying the land in question. She\u00a0said the people occupying the land had told her that this survey map proved they had built their home on the lot they owned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the new field evidence I reached a conclusion as to the location of my client\u2018s lot. There was overwhelming evidence that the people who had torn down the existing home and built a new one had done so on my client\u2018s lot. They actually owned the adjoining lot to the east of my client\u2018s lot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was with a heavy heart that I opened the email my client had sent. I did not relish the idea that some other Professional Land Surveyor may have surveyed the wrong lot and caused this problem. However, I was surprised when I viewed the \"survey\" forwarded from the people occupying the wrong lot. It looked very official with measurements and information like what you would see on a Land Survey but was in fact a digital tax map superimposed over an aerial/satellite photograph. A review of the official county tax map revealed that whoever had created the map had failed to notice that the lots were of varying width in this subdivision measured in an east-west direction. Whoever had plotted and digitized the official county tax map had simply given the lots all the same width causing a shift in the de-picted location of the lots and their actual location on the ground by as much as 60 feet in either an east or west direction as you traveled across the block the subject lot was located in. This made it appear as if the lot these people had built their home on was the lot they owned on the official county tax map.\u00a0I was relieved that a Land Surveyor had not caused this problem but I was very shocked that this \"survey\" that was not a Land Survey had created this apparent mess.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I sent a field crew out to stake the lot corners that were missing and I began to draft the final version of the Standard Land Survey for my client. My field crew contacted me from the site in question. The field crew had finished placing the boundary stakes but the people occupying the land, who had seen where the stakes were falling, were telling them to leave their property.\u00a0I released the finished survey to my client and with their permission transmitted a copy to the people actually occupying the lot in question. I urged my client to consider some alternative to legal action such as exchanging a quit claim deed with the people occupying the lot for a quit claim deed to the adjoining lot which these people actually owned. The adjoining lot however was vacant and my clients had\u00a0purchased a lot with a house on it, a house they planned to try to eventually renovate and sell. The people who had built their home on the wrong lot because of the erroneous \"survey\" had torn that home down to build the new one that was now on the wrong lot. It was a mess of epic proportions. I recommended a good real property lawyer I knew but to say my client was distressed by what I had discovered would be an understatement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Various parties contacted me over the next couple of weeks either associated with my client or associated with the people who had built their home on the wrong lot. I spent numerous hours on the phone explaining the problem to what seemed to be an endless list of concerned parties. Some of the people who contacted me were threatening, some disavowed liability or responsibility and others seemed intent on disproving the results of my survey. Some called to insist that I produce material that I had not contracted to gather or provide in the\u00a0</p>\n<p>course of the survey I performed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The phone calls have now ceased and I have not heard from anyone regard-ing the matter for a couple of months. I don\u2018t know how this matter was resolved or if it was resolved.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I must confess being shocked however regarding this \"express disaster\" and I wonder how a Professional Land Sur-veyor in Texas has been allowed to be displaced by a composite of GIS information that has no basis in reality.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Is not the role of the Professional Land Surveyor to protect the public? How do I protect the public if they are allowed to injure themselves before I arrive on the scene? Is not one of the purposes of a professional Land Survey to reduce litigation?\u00a0The fees I charge for a professional Land Survey will have to increase fivefold if every simple lot survey I perform becomes an exercise in real property litigation. Is this fair to the public?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(This article appeared in the Journal of the Gulf Coast Surveyor, April 25, 2011, and was written by Deward Karl Bowles under the pen name Penn Cheneying).</p>\n<a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/cp3BhX07pepiY1W2G2849u0Us8YIpltPqViqnYE5ffjxP2zgDkel8O4hqPKK5A9vLrSQrCgXILtcEX58awNKgheSwGPuvDYp/H01189003.jpg\"><img class=\"align-center\" width=\"750\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/cp3BhX07pepiY1W2G2849u0Us8YIpltPqViqnYE5ffjxP2zgDkel8O4hqPKK5A9vLrSQrCgXILtcEX58awNKgheSwGPuvDYp/H01189003.jpg?width=750\"/></a>","createdDate":"2011-05-10T13:33:47.770Z","updatedDate":"2019-01-04T12:03:06.127Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-05-10T13:33:47.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:40343","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","title":"New Surveyor 2 Surveyor Virtual Conference Room Added to LSU","description":"<p><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/eso0-8-2HYUX0PxnyNC56z0L0JP3bhA0wA0z3P7NF6Yq*3yJUgYEIbMDco3aIQxZwqgJ8va3egvFLRCsyBLpbWEbpF86dif1/surveyor2surveyorchat.png\"><img class=\"align-right\" width=\"128\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/eso0-8-2HYUX0PxnyNC56z0L0JP3bhA0wA0z3P7NF6Yq*3yJUgYEIbMDco3aIQxZwqgJ8va3egvFLRCsyBLpbWEbpF86dif1/surveyor2surveyorchat.png\"/></a>Today, LSU Justin added something to the network (down in the Surveyor Apps bar <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com\">on site</a>) which may seriously change the game a little bit. \u00a0It is a <strong>Virtual Surveyors Conference/ Chat Room</strong> that can be used anytime for discussing anything you like with your friends and associates here on <strong>Land Surveyors United</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-5\">How Does the Surveyors Conference Chat Room Work?</span></p>\n<p>Basically, the more connections (friend/associates) you have on Land Surveyors United, the more people you will have available to chat with in this room. \u00a0When yo log in, you'll see a little red number, which indicates the number of friends you have online at the same time as you. \u00a0If you're seeing very low numbers, it means you need to ask some of your fellow land surveyors here on the network to be your friend. \u00a0<em>It's as simple as that</em>. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-5\">How to Find Other Surveyors You Know on LSU</span></p>\n<p>The easiest way to find friends on LSU is to simply head over to the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/main/invitation/new?xg_source=tab\">Recruit page</a> and import your contacts from your email address (which we do not store) and it will instantly search the network for other surveyors you already know. \u00a0Another simple way to do this is to go to the groups page and join the support group for your location, which will have other surveyors from your area. \u00a0If there are not a lot of surveyors already in that group, simply invite some that you know. \u00a0In the near future, these local groups are gonna become a BIG DEAL around the network.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/D8pBI6dVaRlFRoyDcDe9V*tNTZDkwkqsjUj*cKMU8X4rgq0Sezm1UO3P5McA3rFXVdyPxjUUlvMqJICK9CN6uaQsi1jlONv1/surveyor2surveyorchatroom.jpg\"><img class=\"align-center\" width=\"601\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/D8pBI6dVaRlFRoyDcDe9V*tNTZDkwkqsjUj*cKMU8X4rgq0Sezm1UO3P5McA3rFXVdyPxjUUlvMqJICK9CN6uaQsi1jlONv1/surveyor2surveyorchatroom.jpg\"/></a>Enjoy experimenting with the new <strong>Virtual Surveyors Conference room</strong> and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions, please send LSU Justin a message.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>","createdDate":"2011-05-04T02:49:11.322Z","updatedDate":"2016-07-15T00:33:18.508Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-05-04T02:49:11.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:52358","contributorName":"33q9v1tfvblkk","description":"HI","createdDate":"2011-07-25T20:34:44.682Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:40431","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"<p>AWESOME !

The team at YouTube has simplified their video search function quite a bit, making it easier for people to perform advanced searches on YouTube without learning any complicated syntax. Let\u2019s look at some real-world examples:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>#1. Search to Find a specific YouTube channel</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>surveying equipment, channel</em><br/>\nYouTube will have numerous videos related to the land surveying but if you are only looking for an official YouTube channel of say a manufacturer, add the word channel to your query separated by a comma.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>#2. Just Limit your search to recently uploaded videos</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>land surveying , this week</em><br/>\nThis will only show recent videos related to land surveying that have been uploaded to YouTube in the past week. Also, you may like to use \u201ctoday\u201d or \u201cthis month\u201d to limit your search to land surveying videos that were uploaded in the past month.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>#3. Search to ONLY find official videos, no fan material included</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Sokkia GSR2700ISX, partner</em><br/>\nIf you are looking for the \u2018official\u2019 Sokkia GSR2700ISX video and don\u2019t want to see any parodies or home-made material in the search results, add the word \u2018partner\u2019 to your search query.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>#4. Search for whole movies on YouTube</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>land surveyors, movie</em><br/>\nYes, you can find full-length movies on YouTube (including Bollywood titles) with land surveyors in them. The search operator for finding movies is, you got it right, movie.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>#5. Only find high-quality videos on YouTube</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Topcon, hd</em><br/>\nAdd the keyword hd to your search query and YouTube will only show High-definition video clips that are either 720p (1280x720) or 1080p (1920x1080 pixels).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>#6. Find 3D video clips on YouTube</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Trimble, 3d</em><br/>\nGot a pair of 3D glasses? Add the keyword 3D to your search query and discover 3D videos. You may also enjoy some 3D content on YouTube without the glasses \u2013 i've tried this with little luck but hopefully in the future we will have some 3D surveying videos to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>#7. Hunt down video playlists on YouTube</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>palmettoequipment, playlist</em><br/>\nPlaylists are a great option if you want to find and watch (or listen) multiple related videos in one go \u2013 like all the Sokkia Total Station videos or your favorite Surveying Field Tricks. You may also copy YouTube playlists to your own account.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>#8. Locate lengthy videos on YouTube</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>surveying lecture, long</em><br/>\nAdd the keyword long to your search query and YouTube will only return videos that are at least 20 minutes in length.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>#9. Perform exact-match searches on YouTube</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>allintitle:\"Sokkia GSR2700 ISX\"</em><br/>\nYes, You can borrow the popular allintitle search operator from Google on YouTube to perform exact title matches.

I have heard too many <strong>out-of-work surveyors</strong> say that they cannot find employment in their state, despite the fact that they have years of experience, a license and have searched \"everywhere.\"</p>\n<p><strong><em>Today I will show you something that I made to prove this very statement wrong</em></strong>. Hopefully, there will be many out of work land surveyors out there who will use this resource and find employment in their area. What I am showing you is a jobs board that I created, which called a Mash Up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a truly revolutionary way to find a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/page/jobs-us-states\">surveying related job in any state of the United States</a> on any given day. <strong>Available Land Surveying jobs</strong> that stream through Dice, Flipdog, Monster, Indeed, Jobster, Yahoo, and several more have all been conveniently combined into one jobs feed for each and every state in the United States. Also, I have included the feed from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jobs.landsurveyorsunited.com\">Land Surveyors United Job Board</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can visit the board for your state on any day and see the combined feed which has automatically been updated with the latest available surveying related positions. I hope you find this to be helpful and you can contact me, Justin Farrow, through Land Surveyors United network with any questions you might have. Good Luck Surveyors!

code - Google Maps - LSU Member Map\" style=\"float: right;\"/></span></p>\n<p>Today I'm going to take a \u00a0short break on the Happy Birthday LSU posts and explain something that has been on my mind for over a year now. \u00a0Namely, the ways that <strong>QR codes</strong> and <strong>bar code scanning</strong> may change the way surveyors do business in the near future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surveyors, did you know that there is such a thing as a <strong>paper-based hyperlink</strong>? \u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Imagine this:</strong></span> \u00a0You get to a jobsite with a set of plans and each page has this wierd code at the bottom that looks like this to your right. \u00a0<em>What is it?</em> \u00a0It a <strong>Quick Respnse (QR) code</strong> and I predict that in the near future we may be seeing more and more of these showing up in the place where a Surveyor's business location and contact information is usually shown. \u00a0Why? \u00a0It's quite simple really....you can scan the code with any cell phone and it will immediately jump to the information that the QR code represents, such as a map to a location, a website address, a photo slideshow or virtually anything web based. \u00a0Let's learn more about QR codes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Where are all of these QR codes?</strong> You\u2019ve probably seen them on billboards, in newspapers, magazines or other paper-based publications: two-dimensional bar codes, called quick response codes (QR codes). <strong>What are they?</strong> QR Codes have been described as paper-based hyperlinks, and this is a good description. You simply take a picture of a QR code with your smart phone, and you get redirected to a website using your cell phone\u2019s browser. They can also be used digitally\u2014you can append a QR code to a Tweet, or they can be displayed on a web page to transfer contact information directly to a cell phone, for example. This technology is blurring the distinction between smart phones, digital destination and content, and paper-based communication mediums. \u00a0For surveyors, this could mean the ability to bring a LOT more information with you to the field. \u00a0Image having a single QR code which indicates a photo album of all benchmarks or property corners on a project. \u00a0<strong><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/forum/topics/how-to-post-surveying-photos\">You'd never lose a single marker ever again</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br/></strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned before, QR technology provides cell phone users the ability to <strong>scan paper-based content</strong> using the cell phone\u2019s camera to decode information on a drawing, a manual, a business card, a gift card, a coupon or a website. Once the QR code has been scanned and decoded, the user has access via their cell phone to the information or destinations that can be any or all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal or company contact information in a MeCard, BlackBerry PIN or BlackBerry vCard.</li>\n<li>An embedded phone number which the phone can dial, or a company home page URL or a specific destination on a social network (i.e. company fan page).</li>\n<li>An RSS feed, SMS or an arbitrary text message.</li>\n<li>An email address or a calendar event with location, title, start and end time, alarm and zone.</li>\n<li>A physical address with location coordinates information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This unadorned code can be visually modified to a certain extent. For example, a number of agencies are providing custom QR codes for businesses that incorporate their logo or an image. These custom codes are referred to as <strong>Design QR Codes</strong>.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/Jlqfs9*l5*prd-SAvTBM5xCruNEgBkvVhhhAJuZFCrf82x*KbvWGDbwTgD4hvi51V0PyshA7EhlfUDzAW5fQT0mC*bbS9t-p/lsuchart.png\"><img class=\"align-left\" width=\"150\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/Jlqfs9*l5*prd-SAvTBM5xCruNEgBkvVhhhAJuZFCrf82x*KbvWGDbwTgD4hvi51V0PyshA7EhlfUDzAW5fQT0mC*bbS9t-p/lsuchart.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/NGQGC*UpPIpKj01ngYL-sCc8FoSyaz-DZ6hP1LcDGusTNISL4P-*mLIGtfVu*mpFhwIizEGkn0HHSwRNgq2uVXx*okODL4fj/lsuchartsmudge.png\"><img class=\"align-left\" width=\"150\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/NGQGC*UpPIpKj01ngYL-sCc8FoSyaz-DZ6hP1LcDGusTNISL4P-*mLIGtfVu*mpFhwIizEGkn0HHSwRNgq2uVXx*okODL4fj/lsuchartsmudge.png\"/></a>Take a look at these design codes that I made. \u00a0In the case of the first code the image (<a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com\" title=\"For Surveyors By Surveyors\">Land Surveyors United</a> Shield) lays on top of a number of the QR code cells, thus obscuring some of the information. Nevertheless, this is not a problem because the information is recreated using robust error correction code technology. In the second code, the individual cells are not obscured by the red LSU image, and the decoder can actually read all the cells. In this case the error correction algorithm is treating the logo as if it was a smudge, and correctly decodes the information.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>So,what else can you do with QR codes?</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>What other possibilities are there?</strong></em> Well, let\u2019s take a look at where ordinary consumers are finding QR codes. They're starting to show up in brochures, magazine ads, web-based and printed maps, food packaging, movie posters, business cards, emails, websites and even ...get this, on the sides of buses. With these vehicles in mind, the current technology could be used in the following manner:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encode contact information or a short white paper on the back of a business card. This enables a paper to digital transfer of information.</li>\n<li>Enable an easy connection by a mobile device to your website. You could also encode a map with directions for company visitors, or encode company information for display in Google maps.</li>\n<li>Track print-based media effectiveness\u2014tracking which ad or poster drove traffic to custom landing pages. Users can also interact with other printed media such as offers on paper-based gift cards and coupons. QR codes can be printed on receipts with additional offers, or provide customer service contact information.</li>\n<li>Users can also interact with digital advertisements. For example, they can scan digital coupons and discount offers on a webpage. You could also place QR codes in an email newsletter for additional offers or for event-based information.</li>\n<li>You can develop loyalty programs\u2014providing special offers on landing pages from paper-based content that is not accessible from any other source. You could push consumers to a website to view the daily offer, to see if they won a free prize or perhaps to participate in a contest. You could also conduct surveys where a user scans one of multiple choice codes and the select response is automatically sent back to the company.</li>\n<li>You can enable product purchase offers, and provide easy access to product information and reviews. You can also provide easy connections to down load applications and content. You could also register a bookmark, append a QR code to a tweet using\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/\">Bit.ly</a>\u00a0or encode access to a special webinar.</li>\n<li>You could print codes with product or contact information on business swag such as coffee cups, t-shirts and hats. I\u2019ve also seen several examples where a QR codes were tattooed on a man\u2019s arm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>So How can the Ordinary Land Surveyor Use QR Codes</strong></p>\n<p>Depending onthe state in which you live, there may be options for experimenting with using QR codes in place of your legal business name, address, contact information, etc. on blueprints and jobsite plans. \u00a0You might also try uploading a set of geographically located photographs of markers on a jobsite to Land Surveyors United into an album, then generate a QR code for the web address of that album so that the next time you are there, you can simply scan the bar code and instantly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/forum/topics/how-to-post-surveying-photos\">pull up all of your markers in one simple step</a>. \u00a0The possibilities are endless...</p>\n<p><strong>QR code generators</strong></p>\n<p>If you wish to experiment with QR codes there are plenty of sites where you can generate codes for free in just seconds\u2014here are a few good ones.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mskynet.com/static/maestro\">http://www.mskynet.com/static/maestro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.qrstuff.com/\">http://www.qrstuff.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://qrcode.kaywa.com/\">http://qrcode.kaywa.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://createqrcode.appspot.com/\">http://createqrcode.appspot.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.beqrious.com/qrcode/create\">http://www.beqrious.com/qrcode/create</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://invx.com/\">http://invx.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Download QR Code Readers</strong></p>\n<p>As well, there are many sources for free QR Code Readers for your smart phone.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.i-nigma.com/Downloadi-nigmaReader.html\">http://www.i-nigma.com/Downloadi-nigmaReader.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reader.kaywa.com/\">http://reader.kaywa.com/</a></li>\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://get.neoreader.com/\">http://get.neoreader.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nds1.nokia.com/NOKIA_COM_1/Microsites/BetaLabs/applications/apps/Nokia_Barcode_Reader_S60_32.sis\">http://nds1.nokia.com//NOKIA_COM_1/Microsites/BetaLabs/applications/apps/Nokia_Barcode_Reader_S60_32.sis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.beetagg.com/supportedphones/\">http://www.beetagg.com/supportedphones/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/zxing/wiki/GetTheReader\">http://code.google.com/p/zxing/wiki/GetTheReader</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>More Reading about QR Codes on Land Surveyors United:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Video:\u00a0<a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/xn/detail/544331:Video:32141\">QR Maps</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Video:\u00a0<a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/xn/detail/544331:Video:27356\">How easy it is to read 2D Barcodes, Surveyors?</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Blog Post:\u00a0<a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/xn/detail/544331:BlogPost:31867\">Surveyors, Have You Claimed Your Business with Google?</a><br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any ideas of ways you think using QR codes in your surveying life might be beneficial? \u00a0Share your ideas below..</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>","createdDate":"2011-03-16T21:05:39.765Z","updatedDate":"2018-11-08T21:13:09.518Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-03-16T21:05:39.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:66590","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","description":"<p><a href=\"http://www.labnol.org/internet/tools/qr-codes-share-text-inside-images/3867/\">QR Codes</a> offer an easy way to transfer information information from any screen \u2013 like your computer desktop, display window at a retail store or even the ads in a newspaper \u2013 to your mobile phone.</p>\n<p>You may use QR codes to send all kinds of text-only data to a mobile including web page URLs, email addresses, business cards, postal addresses and even phone numbers.

This has by no means been an easy and quick process and it is with great excitement that I share this with you today. I know that for most social networks, attracting one hundred members may seem almost too small to make the news. But when you consider the possibility of there only being around 1000-5000 land surveyors in the world online at the same time, you may just see what my excitement is all about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><span class=\"font-size-5\"><strong>The Big Change in Land Surveying</strong></span></div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><span>Ok,so I had a handful of professional land surveyors who had signed up, were committed and they began sharing resources and I began to become excited to see a member take time out of their day to share something with the community. \u00a0However, the ways that surveyors were sharing information were fundamentally different than that which can be found in other 'social networks.' \u00a0Again, returning to the notion that there would need to be a scientific (anthropological) approach applied to this experiment, I made it my own personal responsibility to teach \"social media\" to land surveyors,because it became apparent that no other person in the industry seemed qualified to do so. \u00a0On the day LSU reached 100 members, I closed the blog post with the following:</span></div>\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><blockquote><p>I consider it an honor to have gained the respect of an industry that is for the most part comprised of individuals who spent the majority of their time offline.\u00a0 When I began creating the network almost one year ago, i decided to let it grow organically by moderating the membership to only allow land surveying professionals who truly yearn to share their surveying life and experiences with a community of like-minded individuals.\u00a0 Originally started as somewhat of a social experiment conducted on behalf of my father, Skip, over time I began to realize how much the land surveying industry needed a place to socialize in a not always dead serious manner about the goings-on of the industry.\u00a0 As a graduate student of anthropology, this is just the sort of thing that I enjoy- the study of how social networks grow.\u00a0 Nevertheless, it is the needs of those in the industry which have attracted over 100 members, not me.\u00a0 Surveyors needed a place to\u00a0<a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2007/04/job-board-for-land-surveying-and.html\">find and post jobs</a>. LSU provides such a place.\u00a0 They needed support documents to peruse and a place to vent about problems in the field.\u00a0 Again, LSU is this place.\u00a0 Professionals needed a way to share and discover tips of the trade and a place to upload and share videos and tutorials that everyone in the community could learn from.\u00a0 But most of all, land surveyors needed a voice that could be heard.\u00a0 When technology breaks down or is just too damn hard to understand, LSU members have only one place they need to go-<i>to the community with a request for help</i>.\u00a0\u00a0<br/> <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.ning.com/\">Land Surveyors United</a>\u00a0overcomes geographical boundries and language barriers because members are from all over the planet and work in every environment known to man. Together, members of LSU are now learning the fundamentals of\u00a0<a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2008/06/cool-new-thing-rss-hugger-and-why.html\">blogging and RSS syndication</a>\u00a0of information that they need in order to progress or just stay up to date.\u00a0 This type of learning is almost imperitive today in order to keep up with competition.\u00a0 With only a little bit of research, it is not hard to see that LSU has already begun to reshape the industry or at least the ways in which information is swapped and shared.\u00a0 I could go on for days about all that LSU is and will become, but I'd rather you just\u00a0<a href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/mIPhWuyPvDtaoCD88bibyM6u9xdXYeJbmTPDRjbvWbsxlYgDTVvhmNHoOvjsdU1GYhYEt5NAdhadYYj3RHf372Cfb0DL2oB-/what_is_LSU.html\">read a document that i created for the group</a>\u00a0and if you're not already a member, you should join us!<br/>\nWelcome to all of the new members and if there is anything at all that I can help you with, please do not hesitate to ask.\u00a0 Enjoy\u00a0<i>your</i>\u00a0social network!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><p class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node C01o04sm\"><span class=\"font-size-5\"><strong>How Communities Succeed</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node C01o04sm\"><span>Communities succeed when they reach a <em>critical mass of activity</em>, <em>not a critical mass of members</em>. Despite what other networks or surveying forum boards like to boast, t<span>here isn't such a thing as a critical mass of members, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">it doesn't exist</span>. The only way for a community to accumulate critical mass of members is to either pull a publicity stunt, spam other networks with links back to a source or to produce an immediately gratifying solution to a current problem with something important to people's lives. \u00a0Nevertheless, with time and effort, a critical mass of activity is very much possible - but <em>it is as hard to achieve</em> as you might imagine.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node C01o04sm\"></p>\n<p class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node I01f03pu\">Again, despite the boastings of other surveying boards,if you think you need lots of members to get activity, you're wrong.\u00a0<span>My goal was then to reach that critical mass of activity amongst the members i had. My goal was to build slowly, for example I hoped for 5000 interactions per month at this time, because I had only 100 members. \u00a0But in the future I projected 25000 interactions when LSU came to 500 members. At this point I began to finally start looking around at other social networks for possible ways of 'creating' discussions, but discovered right away that nothing these other networks were driven by could ever power a serious network of land surveyors. And because no such place existed for surveyors, I had nothing else to work off of and no other source of inspiration. \u00a0My inspiration would have to be my own list of objectives. \u00a0Surveyors communicate in highly specific ways...ways that are not typical with other online social networks. \u00a0I started to move away from the whole idea of building a \"social network\" for land surveyors and began to gravitate more towards a network built on \"<em>social support</em>\".</span></p>\n<span><br/>\n</span>\n<p class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node N01a23dp\"><span>Naturally, I needed my few members to interact with one another because members need others to talk to,engage with and in the case of land surveyors, compare notes. \u00a0I knew that any community that begins with a big promotion push fails. It's the communities that start small, reach a critical mass of activity per member, then keep growing at that level of activity which succeed.\u00a0<span>This means, during this time I needed to focus on starting discussions and measuring the outcomes. \u00a0 In order to accomplish this, I realized that I needed to do something radically different than other surveying boards in the past...<em>I had to find way to do the unthinkable</em>...namely, somehow remove cultural boundaries, bring communication gaps with translation tools and open the community up to the entire globe. \u00a0I needed to create corners of this network <em>which actually existed in all parts of the world</em>....that is to say, when <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/group/surveyorsafrica\">a land surveyor from Africa</a> started a discussion about surveying in their region of the world, that discussion would be considered network news which virtually\u00a0<em>came from that part of the world</em>, carrying with it geographically unique and culturally specific terminology, ecological conditions,social and professional norms.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node N01a23dp\"><span><span><br/></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node N01a23dp\"><span><span>Below are a few dated excepts which demonstrate where my head was going during these times. \u00a0You will notice that what I was trying my best to do was educate land surveyors about ways to share information, provide ways for surveyors to support one another and promote socialization of surveying knowledge:</span></span></p>\n<div><span><span><br/></span></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div class=\"social_button dg\">Friday, April 27, 2007 \u00a0\u00a0</div>\n<h2 class=\"post-title\"><a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2007/04/job-board-for-land-surveying-and.html\">Job Board For Land Surveying and Surveyor's Chat Room Added To Network</a></h2>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surveyors (both <a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2007/03/magellan-ashtech-thales-zmaxnet-demo.html\"><em>new school</em> and <em>old school</em></a>) really should have these tools of communication . They are among the most technology driven workers in the world. And although the information that they gather day to day in the field is so vitally important to our understanding of the earth and our growth as a society, it isn't hard to imagine how difficult it must be for surveyors to stay up to date in respect to changes in technology. I hope to eventually have created a few useful avenues of exploration and sharing for the common surveyor. Communication amongst these valued workers in the field, in my opinion shouldn't be limited to the woods. When the day is over and you're back at the office uploading data from the field, what better way to get advice, share stories and get support (<em>burning that company time</em>), than simply logging into an environment full of like minded individuals who know what they are talking about?&amp;nbsp; It takes a mere 5 minutes to set up a profile and announce who you are.&amp;nbsp; In the very least, you'll have learned something, meanwhile setting yourself up for new avenues of <strong>networking</strong> within the industry.</p>\n<p><small class=\"date-header\">Tuesday, May 29, 2007\u00a0</small></p>\n<h2 class=\"post-title\"><a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2007/05/new-thoughts-on-blogging-in-surveying.html\">New Thoughts on Blogging in the Surveying Equipment Industry</a></h2>\n<p><em>Land surveying and construction, as I have come to understand is a tough niche to socialize.\u00a0</em>For many reasons, there should be plenty of you who understand exactly what I mean by this.&amp;nbsp; For example, creating an online network of surveyors for purposes of <a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2007/04/job-board-for-land-surveying-and.html\">socializing ideas about the industry</a> is most definitely <em>not</em> something that can occur over night. For one, those out there who I ultimately would like to connect with (and encourage to interact with one another) are for the most part standing behind a total station somewhere in the middle of the forest all day. Thus, my engagement with their needs can only occur when and if someone writes me a message or leaves an inquiry <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.ning.com/\">on a forum</a> of some sort.&amp;nbsp; I'm not out looking to sell them a piece of equipment they can't operate, but rather I want those that I help to find themselves not only satisfied with the tools they have chosen, I hope they somehow come to feel more comfortable with their choice, knowing that our relationship will yield endless support for them in the future. I certainly will not always have all of the answers but the they can always count on Palmetto knowing where to look for solutions.<br/> <br/>\n<strong>What are we doing here.... <em>Rebranding</em>?</strong><br/>\nYes. Well, if Entrepreneur.com is a worthy source, let's just say that <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/marketing/branding/imageandbrandingcolumnistjohnwilliams/article159470.html\">we are partially rebranding</a>. Palmetto Equipment has been a reliable company from the start, due to the values that my dad placed upon <strong>customer service</strong>- <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the one real thing that this industry lacks</span>. It seems that this industry is being so consumed by the mergers and corporate takeovers that are occurring, that it has become difficult for the surveyor himself/ herself to find a company that he/she can count on. \u00a0When all the Allen Precisions and Hayes Instruments of the world become wisked up into the mega-cloud of distributors in the sky, who will there be to take care of the hard working instrument man? \u00a0He's the guy standing on the side of the road cursing himself because he can't seem to work his damn data collector...remember him?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>Finding Thirsty Horses</strong></em><br/>\n<br/>\n<span><font face=\"Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\">One of the biggest corporate dilemmas with online media is how to best interact and engage the customer and prospective customer.

Many (if not most) in my position just want to sell high dollar equipment and just be done with it. However, this industry is changing at such a rapid rate that it has become more important than ever for those who are buying this equipment to have trusted support and channels that lead to answers. <strong>Surveyors are a tight bunch of people while they are out in the woods or along side of the road- they can troubleshoot in remarkable ways when it comes to closing a loop or pulling that impossible shot with precision.</strong>\u00a0This becomes possible due to shared experience, dialog and communication, but mostly because of the</font> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em style=\"font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">teamwork</em></span> <font face=\"Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\">element.What if the same opportunity for connectivity could be found online?

WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!\"</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-5\"><strong>A Bit about Critical Marxism</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Let me first start out by stating that you do not have to agree with Marxist philosophy to understand why this phrase stuck out to me that particular evening, especially since I had read it one thousand times before. \u00a0Nor is it important to understand why others who have implemented a Marxist perspective in their political agendas have failed. \u00a0I am of the opinion that \"Marxism\" (as tried and failed politically) is much different than maintaining a \"Critical Marxist\" perspective. \u00a0Critical Marxist theory has as its base a sharp eye upon historical materialism, which is why this is most applicable at this point in the story. \u00a0Marx, a student of Hegal, looked at history like this: \u00a0<strong>Every stage of history has within its essence the seeds of its own destruction.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0This is what is referred to as the\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic\" target=\"_blank\">Dialectic</a>. \u00a0When I began building Land Surveyors United, i had a strong sense that the history of land surveying as a profession was to blame for the various troubles that seemed to plague the common surveyors in unison. \u00a0These were, like I mentioned before:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every time a surveyor tried to find support from a dealer, they always tried to sell them a new piece of equipment</li>\n<li>Every time a surveyor called the manufacturer for training and support, they told them to call a dealer.</li>\n<li>Every time a surveyor could actually find support, they needed to be at an office</li>\n<li>Every time a surveyor actually needed support, they were out in the field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><span>Now consider why this may have come about and you <strong><em>may</em></strong> first discover that historically, it was the media and publications involved in Surveyor news that created this situation. \u00a0The fundamental flaws in the ways that surveying equipment and services are marketed may have played a part. \u00a0The fact that the majority of land surveyors on the average have/had less access to the internet than most other professional and even less knowledge of computers and social media will surely factor in. \u00a0And then you have those who do utilize the computer to solve problems in the field..<em>.where did they go to find answers?</em>\u00a0\u00a0And once they got there,\u00a0<em>would they be belittled and bashed</em>\u00a0for asking a question? \u00a0These ideas started to really create a brewing experiment in my mind that I needed to work out. \u00a0I actually needed to find those seeds of destruction and create something which had the power to overcome history</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made a few choices right from the gate which I have stuck with throughout the entire process of building Land Surveyors United.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I will not</em> create a surveying support network which is driven by advertising because most surveyors who need support are either having problems with their existing equipment or are looking for unbiased advice about equipment that can solve their problems and provide solutions specific to their projects.</li>\n<li><em>I will not</em> create a network which is built around driving the number of members up superficially, therefore no anonymous members will be allowed. \u00a0Every comment, question or piece of content on the network must come attached to a profile which has a face, a name, a level of expertise and a background of experience. This is what will make LSU different, because it is fundamentally built on integrity and professionalism.</li>\n<li><em>I will not</em> allow LSU to become a place where just anybody can jump in and offer unqualified advise or off-topic discussions, because this is where many of the other boards have failed. When you go to a surveying site and you see discussions on Daytona 500 and Superbowl being the most popular discussions, is there any question why the public no longer takes the surveying profession seriously? \u00a0I mean, seriously...</li>\n<li><em>I will</em> create what I consider to be a \"Living Library\" of topical discussions which in the future will serve as a database of Surveying related knowledge through which any question can be answered and any problem solved.</li>\n<li>I will create a place which is only discovered by surveyors who are searching for a solution and find it within the pages of LSU.\u00a0</li>\n<li>I will not go to other surveying forums and spam those sites in hopes of deterring their members and converting them to LSU members, simply because LSU is not in any way shape or form like those boards. \u00a0LSU would attract a different kind of surveyor..one who is comfortable sharing what they know and is possibly willing to become the authority on a subject related to surveying just by doing so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"body\">Art is always and everywhere the secret confession, and at the same time the immortal movement of its time.~ Karl Marx</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><span class=\"font-size-5\">Surveying Equipment Art?</span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2007/12/art-makes-some-people-scaredand-dirty.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/R2B3K5jGV2I/AAAAAAAABuo/L3TqtIJ-ILw/s400/satellites_GSR2700ISX.jpg?width=300\" class=\"align-right\" width=\"300\"/></a>The truth is, I built land surveyors united during the first two years, operating under the alias of my Father, Skip Farrow and Palmetto Equipment. \u00a0Initially,I felt as though having a place for land surveyors to come together to discuss equipment might make a great place to help my father sell his equipment. However, it wasn't long before I discovered this model to be flawed because it just didn't do enough for surveyors. And when the economy started to crumble I actually began feeling bad about placing new equipment advertisements in the face of surveyors who just needed support for the junk they already had, needed to get working and required to make a living. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The only way I knew how to change any of this was to do it through Art. \u00a0I began to remix media into more attractive (or at least, amusing) chunks of information that I called <em>equipment art</em>. \u00a0I consider this to be the least intrusive method of getting a point across and felt it to be, unlike many other forms of art, an \"art with utility.\" In fact, several of the larger manufacturers started to realize how effective this was for grabbing the attention of surveyors and although they missed the point entirely, they began to create their own more-artistic-than-usual marketing pieces in hopes of grabbing some of the attention I was getting. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>During 2007-2009, Palmetto Equipment and Supply virtually ruled the search engines for the types of equipment Skip sold. \u00a0Even when we didn't have a penny to our names, we were still number 1 on Google, Yahoo and several others for any search term like \"GSR2700 ISX\" or \"Sokkia SRX\" or \"Magellan GPS\"...you name it. \u00a0In fact, once we were involved with a Renewable Energy project with the Pickens Plan and it was to involve the sale of several GSR2700 ISX units, I made some art and a blog post and two days later, Magellan came out with an advertisement which looked strikingly similar.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>My Art featuring a young T-Boone Pickens beside GSR2700 ISX</strong></span> \u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2008/11/little-kids-gps-and-art-in-surveying.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SPD8Roxas2I/AAAAAAAADfY/ol71ss_DpEI/s320-R/pickenplanforGPS.jpg?width=320\" class=\"align-left\" width=\"320\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Magellan's Ad</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2008/11/little-kids-gps-and-art-in-surveying.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SROx44RaH_I/AAAAAAAADts/3M7sBwHfB1Y/s320/img_pm3rtk_hero.jpg?width=320\" class=\"align-left\" width=\"320\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"font-size-5\">More Equipment Art</span></strong></p>\n<p>Back in 2003 when I moved to NYC after undergrad, I became a real estate broker in Brooklyn. \u00a0And although that is a story for an entirely different occasion, I became well known in my area as a real estate agent through use of a term and marketing method which I called \"Artvertising.\" \u00a0When I came down to Charleston and began helping with Palmetto, much of this carried over. \u00a0 It has been fun tracing my steps in reverse to celebrate Land Surveyors United's 4th birthday!

Its about time I reintroduced myself to all of the wonderful and talented <strong>surveyors</strong> in this community. My name is Justin Farrow and I have been creating and maintaining <strong>Land Surveyors United</strong> for exactly 10 years. Many of you may not be aware of this, as I do not make a huge deal out of birthdays, but March is Land Surveyors United's birthday month. This year, <strong>LSU turns 10 years old</strong> this week and to commemorate this occasion, this year I've decided to take a look back at LSU and offer a glimpse into the history of building the world's first and greatest <em>global</em> social support network for land surveyors! I am going to tell the short version of this tale in several parts,starting with the first day of LSU's inception. Let's begin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"font-size-5\">It all started on March 2nd, 2007</span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/2007/03/land-surveyors-united-is-new-social.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SI5Q5DDmxyI/AAAAAAAACbU/lWc9j41iVdM/s512/DSC07484.JPG?width=284\" class=\"align-right\" width=\"284\"/></a>It was at this desk in the back of Palmetto Equipment and Supply store in Charleston, South Carolina that Land Surveyors United was born, <a href=\"http://weblog.palmettoequipment.com/2007/03/land-surveyors-united-is-new-social.html\" target=\"_blank\">with a blog post</a>. I had come down from Brooklyn, New York to visit my family for a month and to assemble a book that I'd been working on for about 5 years for publishing. Upon arriving to Charleston for this visit, I discovered that my father's company wasn't doing very well. The downward spiral of the economy hadn't really taken hold, as of yet, but local land surveyors were starting to have a hard time finding work and the construction industry was starting to lag. My father, Skip Farrow, God rest his soul,\u00a0 had several employees that were, as we discovered, stealing from him and things were starting to unravel. I made a commitment to my father to help take pictures of all the inventory and offered to make him a one-of-a-kind Ebay store, so that he could sell his equipment globally and rely less on the local economy. This is how we do it in New York, so i figured \"<em>Hey, maybe I'll stay 2 months and do this thing to help my dad.</em>\" Little did I know that this adventure would become a ten year journey into the future. I started out by creating an ebay store using this old and busted slow contraption pictured above right, working out of the repair room in the back of Palmetto Equipment store. Although I wouldn't admit it at the time, I did not know what I was getting myself into and discovered quickly the fact that building and operating an Ebay store is a full time job. My life began to vanish. Within 3 days of having items up on the store, I suddenly became aware of how much competition I had selling surveying equipment on Ebay, when one of my new competitors flagged my store 47 times over the course of an hour to have it removed. Why? because I was using the same stock equipment photos that he was using, right off the Sokkia website. He insisted to Ebay that those pictures were his. Ebay removed my store and needless to say, <a href=\"http://weblog.palmettoequipment.com/2007/03/ebay-suspension-and-things-that-make-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">I was upset and I told my readers about it</a>. <em>So what did I <a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SI5Q73Sx9TI/AAAAAAAACbk/kWZowju6Zm0/s512/DSC07486.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SI5Q73Sx9TI/AAAAAAAACbk/kWZowju6Zm0/s512/DSC07486.JPG?width=284\" class=\"align-right\" width=\"284\"/></a>do?</em> I began taking my own branded photographs of the actual equipment, which I uploaded and created \"<a href=\"http://weblog.palmettoequipment.com/2007/12/land-surveying-equipment-art.html\" target=\"_blank\">equipment art</a>\" from, while working with Ebay to restore my account. When they did, I blasted the surveying world with <a href=\"http://weblog.palmettoequipment.com/2007/03/ebay-update-and-custom-equipment.html\" target=\"_blank\">new creative ammunition</a> and the game was back on. I built a Palmetto Equipment website using a google service called Pages which is now extinct and replaced by the new Google Sites. <a href=\"http://weblog.palmettoequipment.com/2007/12/art-makes-some-people-scaredand-dirty.html\" target=\"_blank\">The competition got dirty</a>. However, with 8 years of real estate experience in New York City under my belt, I had grown accustomed to dealing with competition. \u00a0I maintained (and at times obsessed over)\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com\">a surveying equipment blog</a> which is now retired with my dad's passing. With that little site, we climbed the search engines, becoming number 1 in search results for just about everything my father sold, and at times even showing up above the manufacturers' websites. <em>It became fun.</em> However, it was a one-dimensional presence which could never fully support all of the surveyors I wanted to help. It became my personal responsibility. The more broke we became, the more excited I became because what I had created was something that surveyors needed - a place to find affordable equipment. As long as I made my own art work and created my own marketing materials, there was absolutely no way that anyone could ever take this away from my father; and that gave him hope and the confidence to make it through the tough time and the even more difficult economic times to come. Nevertheless, there was one missing piece that I just couldn't wrap my mind around; the problems that surveyors were having daily finding support for all of this high-priced equipment.</p>\n<p><strong><em>There were a few trends that seemed to be haunting the surveying industry.</em></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every time a surveyor tried to find support from a dealer, they always tried to sell them a new piece of equipment</li>\n<li>Every time a surveyor called the manufacturer for training and support, they told them to call a dealer.</li>\n<li>Every time a surveyor could actually find support, they needed to be at an office</li>\n<li>Every time a surveyor actually needed support, they were out in the field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/TXZ4mhfqskI/AAAAAAAAHR0/69CxuXUjxdc/website_thumb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/TXZ4mhfqskI/AAAAAAAAHR0/69CxuXUjxdc/website_thumb.jpg\" class=\"align-center\"/></a><em>ePalmetto Site Circa March 2007</em></p>\n<p>Here I sat in room surrounded by hundreds of instruments and data collection devices, all needing upgrades to the new software versions (which would only run with proper firmware),cables to god-knows-what and a constant stream of support issues that my father no longer had employees to handle. However I noticed something one day when three surveyors from different companies were in the office.\u00a0 It reminded me of dozens of conversations I had overheard as a kid working in the family blueprint shop. One guy brings up an issue he was having with his total station....another guy says \"oh yeah,I had that problem once..this is what you do.\" The third guy said \"man, I never thought about that...maybe that will work on my total station..let me write this down.\" BOOM,i realized that a surveyor's best tech support is another experienced surveyor. I thought to myself, \"Someone has GOT to bring surveyors together in a place where any and every aspect of land surveying can be discussed and discovered. If the manufacturers weren't willing to do this, I would have to...as a cultural experiment. \"Later that night, I remember stumbling across some old philosophy class notes from a class I took which explored \"Karl Marx and Critical Marxism\" and while skimming through them one phrase in the Communist Manifesto stood out to me in an entirely new way:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SylMjRGvOXI/AAAAAAAAGEw/mN-ZzZgszpo/LSULOGO.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SylMjRGvOXI/AAAAAAAAGEw/mN-ZzZgszpo/LSULOGO.jpg\" class=\"align-center\"/></a>LSU's first Logo in 2007</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I assume I do not need to explain the many reasons why this jumped out at me. That was on March 1st 2007. The next day I started my hunt for a solution; found one, and ran with it. Today we are all sharing this idea. I will let you ponder that a bit and will continue with part two tomorrow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blogs/happy-birthday-land-surveyors\" title=\"Happy Birthday Land Surveyors United!

Board members essentially serve as impartial judge and jury, whereas investigators and prosecutors are separate and firewalled, with investigators serving as the police and detectives, and attorneys serving as District Attorney to prosecute cases. \u00a0As with a regular court of law, there are generally strict rules of separation between these. \u00a0For example, if a prosecutor or witness for the state were off whispering in the ear of the jury in a criminal trial, giving them inside information or hearsay, it would and should be declared an immediate mistrial. \u00a0Similarly, if the judge or jury were giving either defense attorney or prosecuting D.A. advice on how to advance the case in order to secure acquittal or conviction, it would violate those rules of impartiality.</p>\n<p><br/>Typically, Board members can only act on what is presented before them in a hearing. \u00a0And what is presented in a hearing is typically constrained to what can be gleaned from complaints, and backed up with evidence. \u00a0One shortcoming is that in many instances, the investigators are former law enforcement personnel, who may have excellent knowledge in gathering evidence, questioning witnesses and respondents, and so on - they typically do not have domain expertise in surveying, to know whether boundary discrepancies or other technical issues are significant or not. \u00a0Likewise, the prosecutors are attorneys, similarly with limited technical expertise. \u00a0Along with this, is typically a lack of in-house, independent technical expertise - an objective professional with no axes to grind.</p>\n<p><br/>While the system is not perfect, it is really not the problem. \u00a0The problem is broader, and cultural. \u00a0For one, surveyors are typically loath to turn in their fellow professionals, even when they are aware of gross incompetence. \u00a0And laymen typically don't have enough technical knowledge to know better, unless there is gross negligence or incompetence, such as failing to deliver. \u00a0This drags perceptions about surveyors down. \u00a0And further, the professional societies have become increasingly weak and ineffectual, falling further and further behind the times, particularly relative to the huge opportunities that surveyors should be exploring, such as GIS - with far less cohesion, unity and clarity of vision than other professional societies.</p>\n<p><br/>We are indeed in trouble, folks. \u00a0This should be a wake-up call to professionals in all jurisdictions, to re-think and re-evaluate, and re-group for the future.</p>","createdDate":"2011-03-22T03:18:34.927Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:36031","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"<p>anonymous responder #2 says:</p>\n<p>Yes, Justin and there are many things that have been difficult to put into words. \u00a0 I have been trying to think of the words that will explain how and why the process has become so corrupted in reason.</p>\n<div><blockquote>The Board pays people who \"admittedly\" are not surveyors and they hire other surveyors who are known for their cruelty to build a case against a surveyor that is so\u00a0overwhelming\u00a0and filled with technical traps, that the surveyor cannot afford to defend themselves. \u00a0These investigators get paid big bucks to spend many hours to pile up volumes of wording that can make a surveyor \u00a0look horrible when the surveyor has done a fantastic job to provide his client with the evidence and documents to solve a fence or other boundary feature problem.<div>If the State would put the\u00a0investigation\u00a0effort to figuring out why the client filed the complaint and discovered the truth that the client had been advised by a relative who wanted the estate of the client and found a way to keep from paying for the survey that started the whole bolder rolling to destroy the surveyor with over 35 years of experience and valuable services, then the\u00a0frivolous\u00a0and\u00a0vivacious\u00a0complaints would stop. \u00a0</div>\n<div>I ran across and article about California. \u00a0They have already realized that they Board needs to protect surveyors from the dead beat clients who expect the surveyor to work for free and then be devastated by a Board to put them out of business and harm their reputation and family forever. \u00a0They are literally and figuratively murdering hard working, experienced, senior, surveyors who have dedicated their life and dreams to making the world a better place by providing the public evidence so they can understand the position of their property and features related to the evidence of their property boundary.\u00a0</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<p></p>","createdDate":"2011-02-13T19:57:32.822Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:36025","contributorName":"3ou6s8v8diupk","description":"<p>Not sure my opinion on this will be popular, but I have to wonder if this is just one effect of the profession's decision many years ago to limit licensure to a select few. I've worked in and around surveying long enough (about 30 years) to have watched it go from granting licenses to professional engineers to restricting licenses to those with advanced degrees and experience strictly in land surveying. From watching all that unfold, I realize this was done to limit competition. But I remember through it all wondering if it would have a negative effect. It seemed to close off the profession to those like myself who had a strong interest and involvement in it. People like me had to make a choice to either get a professional engineer's license or a land surveyor's license because getting both was very difficult. I still perform work related to land surveying, but now I either perform work not requiring a license or I do the work under a lawyer's oversight.</p>\n<p>So while reducing numbers might have limited competition, it also reduced input of money, interest, and resources into the profession. And we all understand in the political arena, you have more leverage the greater your membership. Closing off the profession also has seemed to push surveyors into their own little corner. I see so many areas where technology has opened new business opportunities for surveyors, but because of this decision to close the profession off to anyone else, I don't see surveyors on the teams delivering these services.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What's the solution and can this be turned around? From working in land surveying, I realize you do need to ensure someone has relevant experience before granting them a license. So you can't just start handing out licenses to anyone with a transit and range pole. But perhaps what the profession needs to do is evaluate the direction they chose many many years ago.

I pose this question to you... What is happening to our profession? Yesterday, I was riding to a project site making conversation with one of my younger co-workers, and I asked him if he enjoyed surveying. The response I got made me physically ill. He quickly responded by saying, \"No, I hate it. Surveying is a dead-end job.\" I was stunned! So I asked him why he felt that way. He proceeded to tell me that when he started working in the surveying field, he wanted to learn any and everything he could about surveying. He would pickup articles or browse through YouTube to watch different video clips. Then as time would pass, different jobs were given to him and he wanted to know more about the ins and outs of how the data was processed and how the end result was reached. To his surprise, he was told not to worry about it, just go collect the data. At that point, his interest diminished and he became a button pusher.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>First, if we don't explain the reasoning behind the task, then how we to know the correct data are has been collected?\u00a0 Or worse, if they develop an I don't care attitude or it's just a paycheck, which\u2019s to say in what manner they collect the data?\u00a0 Well, that's close enough or they won't know the difference. Then comes the many return trips to the same site which in the long run cost you more money. This could end you up in court or before your state board.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Second job security is one thing. I know from my own experiences, the more I wanted to learn or inquired, people that I worked with found them threaten and began withholding information. So being the Bulldog I am, if you can't go around the bush and you can't jump over it, you go right through it! And that is just what I did! Hence the nickname Bulldog, among others, but that's a different story. I feel it's wrong to stifle someone's curiosity or their willingness to learn the reasons why they are performing the task at hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And third, who are the surveyors of tomorrow? Kids today are all about video games and feel that they are entitled to these cushy careers they see and hear about on TV or the internet. If we don\u2019t feed the curious and the eager to learn, then the professional known as the surveyor will become a dying breed.</p>\n<p>Surveying is a hard, demanding job. You have to deal with the elements, critters, and the occasional upset property owner. For me, being able to retrace an old boundary and recover some of the existing monumentation left by someone else from years gone by is very rewarding. Or even performing construction staking of a Wal-Mart that now I shop at, knowing I set the corners of this structure and walking through the store remembering how hot or cold it was during those days of construction. Remembering setting the blue-tops for the dirt so the concrete could be poured. Knowing I had a part in the construction of this building that will be here for years to come. Not to mention, I have seen some pretty amazing mornings when the sun is just coming up and some gorgeous sunsets as the sun sits below the horizon. I have found some original BLM monuments and seen some really weird ones as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So in closing, I can't help but remember a cartoon I saw in P.O.B. magazine, you all know the one I am talking about, where the Rod-man wants to be the Instrument-man, the Instrument-man wants to be the Party-chief, Party-Chief wants to be the Surveyor with his feet kicked up on the desk. And the Surveyor wants to be the Rod-man. I will take the field any day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So again, I ask the question, \"What is happening to our profession?\" I will continue to do my part, how about you?</p>","createdDate":"2011-02-05T02:59:47.094Z","updatedDate":"2018-10-12T10:59:53.591Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-02-05T02:59:47.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:35363","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","title":"What you should know when purchasing real property","description":"<p>Often a Title Insurance firm will make an offer to the concerned parties to hire a Land Surveyor to produce a Land Survey for their real estate transaction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The agreements between the Title Insurance firm and the Land Surveyor often are made with the understanding that the Land Surveyor will continue to get work orders from the Title Insurance firm if they will not be paid for the Land Survey if the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/9-8MGB0g6hI2b8vfsCaGfbrGXwrOsiShgFgIwqNxsjDBnJIX2gmSndY0QfatOw3HlfEGKyF9azoY6PujVLi37pAV1pHSH7l1/goat_stake.png\"><img class=\"align-right\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/9-8MGB0g6hI2b8vfsCaGfbrGXwrOsiShgFgIwqNxsjDBnJIX2gmSndY0QfatOw3HlfEGKyF9azoY6PujVLi37pAV1pHSH7l1/goat_stake.png?width=250\" width=\"250\"/></a>transaction does not close, the Land Surveyor will produce the Land Survey at an artificially low price and the Land Surveyor will produce the Land Survey in a short and set time limit. These types of agreements are a violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (<a href=\"http://www.marealtor.com/content/respa.htm\">http://www.marealtor.com/content/respa.htm</a>) in\u00a0my opinion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The presumption that the <strong>Land Surveyor</strong> is a disinterested third party evaporates in a circumstance where the Land Surveyor is only paid if the transaction closes. A Land Surveyor can be tempted to not make a thorough search of the Public Records or evidence found in the field if their budget is exceeded in the process of producing the Land Survey. A Land Surveyor can be tempted to not make a thorough search of the Public Records or evidence found in the field if such an endeavor would cause them not to meet the deadline for delivery of their product.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the case where errors are\u00a0found in the description of the subject property provided to\u00a0an independent Land Surveyor\u00a0by the Title Insurance Firm, the Title Insurance firm will not be happy when contacted to report problems found. An Independent Land Surveyor's findings potentially may delay the closing. This is why I recommend that you should always hire an independent Land Surveyor when entering into a real estate transaction.</p>\n<h3>The Problems</h3>\n<p>The problems found by an independent <strong>Land Surveyor</strong> potentially may save thousands of dollars and untold headaches in the future. In many cases the lower fee charged by the Land Surveyor hired by the Title Insurance firm is actually more expensive than the fee charged by an independent Land Surveyor because the fees charged by the Land Surveyor hired by the Title Insurance firm are simply made part of the loan. The interest payments alone on those fees, over the time period of the loan, often far exceed the cost of an independent Land Survey many fold.Problems found by an independent Land Survey can be used to negotiate the price and terms for a transaction on real property between the concerned parties, thus more than covering the fee for an independent Land Survey.</p>\n<h3>In Real Estate</h3>\n<p>Most real estate professionals involved in a real estate transaction have vested interests in the transaction closing. Many people have no experience in a real estate transaction yet a home in most cases is the most expensive item they will ever purchase in their lifetime. A Land Surveyor should never have any interest in the real estate transaction they are producing a Land Survey for.</p>","createdDate":"2011-02-03T03:00:26.783Z","updatedDate":"2017-10-12T00:55:28.525Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-02-03T03:00:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:35367","contributorName":"2t21zb0xl49u8","description":"<p>I totally agree Karl..</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>i might add that is also a violation of minimum standards in alot of states, alot of states, AZ being one requires a written agreement for services.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>work with a title company can help get your business off the ground, and get you started, and is a tough way to make a living sometimes, being under such demands</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>this is where i think, educating the public goes alot further... the title attorneys are not considered as Joe blow, and they don't want to hear about the problems we found on there survey they just ordered</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"i don't want the labor pains, i just want the baby\" attitude is pushing surveyors to extinction,\u00a0 if they don't comply, there is someone who will WTH?</p>","createdDate":"2011-02-03T03:41:32.820Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:34738","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","title":"Chain!","description":"<a href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/waHjnIcZJgwUVctgFFAmgXn9bc9COsZhOR2UXWLqSZgKGfOz4XDnEzN8WSX50c8W5yi16KpeyMmUJycbiIQ8MG3fGdmWJxdt/gavel1.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img class=\"align-full\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/waHjnIcZJgwUVctgFFAmgXn9bc9COsZhOR2UXWLqSZgKGfOz4XDnEzN8WSX50c8W5yi16KpeyMmUJycbiIQ8MG3fGdmWJxdt/gavel1.jpg?width=750\" width=\"750\"/></a><p>Chain!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The theory behind surveying practice has never been the notion of the surveyor. It is rooted in a far older idea shaped by the sovereign that all land was held under. Physically and literally defending the land is where rights to land emanated from.</p>\n<p>We have gradually tried to tame physical force with law to give a veneer of civility to our society, however the absoluteness of physical possession remain as a basis for the ultimate claim to land. This principle is reflected in modern real property law just as it was in the past. Legal decisions are built on other legal decisions and as such the same is that of profession of land surveying.</p>\n<p>Occasionally there are court decisions which are questionable for various reasons, depending on what one believes and understands, about land surveying theory. Indeed one can cite many court decisions to support almost any specific point of view regarding a certain idea for land surveying practice.</p>\n<p>Some surveyors have come to the conclusion that the legal system offers no real benefit as a resort but are just as adamant that surveyors should look to the law as a mandate for surveyors to adjudicate property boundaries with beginning points and bounds of their own notion. They suggest that traditional surveying theory and practice are irrelevant and based on understandings and definitions of surveyors, contrary to modern case law and the dynamic of neo professional land surveyor.</p>\n<p>I would suggest that superficial views of certain case law can be distorted to suit most any presupposition particularly when it is used in a manner to exalt one\u2019s ego as a professional land surveyor by belittling other surveyors.</p>\n<p>Understandings gained from examining case law is limited to the information that can be gathered behind the case summaries or opinions published. \u00a0Some have made assertions recently regarding particular court cases and opinions that can\u2019t be supported by any investigation of the underlying facts beyond a shallow cursory review.</p>\n<p>[i]Olson v. Jude 2003 MT 186; 316 Mont. 438; 73 P.3d 809; 2003 [i/] (1) for instance is just such a case. In 1957, the Zollingers decided to subdivide their property. They hired Earl Best to survey and prepare a subdivision plat for a portion of the property this subdivision became known as the Big Horn Tract. The Zollingers subsequently conveyed the property, other than the Big Horn Tract to others. The Judes began purchasing the Big Horn Tract lots in 1985 for investment purposes.</p>\n<p>A conflict arose when it became apparent that the Big Horn Tract subdivision as staked by Earl Best fell short of the boundary of the lands owned by the Zollingers. The court worded as follows \u201cWhile the Certificate of Dedication and Plat E-52 itself identify the northern boundary of the Big Horn Tract as being along the east-west quarter section line, Best placed his monuments for the northern boundary 108 feet south of the east-west quarter section line. Best's failure to correctly retrace the east-west quarter section line created a discrepancy between the description contained in the Zollinger's Certificate of Dedication on Plat E-52 and the location of the monuments Best set pursuant to the survey. While the Certificate of Dedication and Plat E-52 itself identify the northern boundary of the Big Horn Tract as being along the east-west quarter section line, Best placed his monuments for the northern boundary 108 feet south of the east-west quarter section line\u201d.</p>\n<p>The facts of this case are that in 1905, Ralph and Howard Bushnell had surveyed Section 32, Township 6 South, Range 4 East, Gallatin County, Montana, under contract to the United States Government. The Bushnells established corners at half-mile intervals for creating sections and quarter sections. They started from the corner of Sections 4, 5, 32 and 33, and proceeded north 0 degrees 4 feet west between Sections 32 and 33. At 40 chains, or halfway between section lines, they placed a 16 inch by 9 inch by 5 inch granite stone 11 inches into the ground. The inscription \" 1/4 \" was marked on its west face. The stone monumented the east quarter corner of Section 32 and denotes the eastern terminus of the east-west quarter section line through Section 32.</p>\n<p>Best was the original surveyor of the lines of the Big Horn Tract Subdivision but not of the east-west quarter section line. In this case the court noted that \u201cthe Big Horn Tract plat references two original government corners. Best utilized the \"SW corner NE 1/80 Ga. 134, 4 SE 1/4 Sec. 32 T6S, R4E, M.P.M.\" as the starting point of his survey for the Big Horn Tract. Furthermore, [i] rather than being the creator of the east-west quarter section line of Section 32, Best was only retracing it, and he retraced it incorrectly [i/]. The original government surveyors started at the corner of Sections 4, 5, 32 and 33 and proceeded north to establish the quarter section monument. As reflected by the location of his placed monuments,[i] Best made no effort to follow the footsteps of the original government surveyors even though it was his duty as a surveyor [i/]. Best's failure to correctly locate and identify the original corners caused him to place his monuments for the northern boundary of the Big Horn Tract 108 feet south of the east-west quarter section line even though Plat E-52 shows the northern boundary lying along the east-west quarter section line.\u201d.</p>\n<p>In September 1994, an architectural firm hired by the Judes retained Mark Chandler with C &amp; H Engineering and Surveying, Inc., A subsequent resurvey was performed by Chandler. Chandler opined that it was the Zollingers' intention that the northern boundary of the Big Horn Tract be located along the east-west quarter section line of Section 32, not at the point where Best set his monuments which. In November 1994, Ron Allen of Allen &amp; Associates surveyed the location of monuments in the Big Horn Tract subdivision. Allen relied on Best's erroneously placed monuments to locate the northern boundary of the Big Horn Tract. Allen identified the strip of land located between the northernmost monuments placed by Best and the east-west quarter section line (an area approximately 108 feet by 1200 feet and equaling almost 3 acres) as Tract 1 when he prepared COS 1898. Ultimately Olson claimed ownership of Tract 1, COS 1898, contending that it was not part of the Big Horn Tract subdivision and therefore, it was never conveyed to the Judes. Allen filed COS 1898 with the Gallatin County Clerk and Recorder's Office on July 7, 1995.</p>\n<p>At this point it is time to ask yourself the question of whether the surveyors in this case could have done something to prevent this discrepancy from rising to the level of a dispute and stopped the concerned parties from seeking a legal remedy. I would suggest that I may have my own opinion that would support one side or the other in this case, however the fact remains that the surveyors in this case both identified the same problem, they simply interpreted the evidence differently and arrived at different conclusions for a resolution to this apparent ambiguity.</p>\n<p>Following a three-day bench trial, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law wherein it determined that because [b]original monuments [b/] control the location of boundaries, Plat E-52's references to the 1905 United States Government survey control the location of the northern boundary of the Big Horn Tract. Consequently, the court concluded that the northern boundary of the Big Horn Tract is along the east-west quarter section line of Section 32, hence Tract 1, COS 1898 is part of the Big Horn Tract.</p>\n<p>Both expert witnesses, Allen and Chandler, testified that when they draft a certificate of dedication, they attempt to draft it according to the property owner's intentions. Moreover, both Allen and Chandler testified that the publication Brown's Boundary Control and Legal Principles (4th ed. 1995), is recognized as an authoritative and reliable authority on the subject of boundary control and related principles.</p>\n<p>The court noted that Allen, who was Olson's own expert witness, testified that Best used improper methodology in surveying the Big Horn Tract.</p>\n<p>The court stated that \u201c[i]fundamental survey principles [i/] provide that the parties' intent is paramount to all other considerations when interpreting surveys and conveyances. In the case sub judice, the Certificate of Dedication on Plat E-52 clearly shows that the Zollingers intended that the northern boundary of the Big Horn Tract extend to the east-west quarter section line and not to Best's erroneously located monuments\u201d and that \u201cBest failed to survey the Big Horn Tract pursuant to the Zollingers' clearly expressed intentions. Plat E-52's references to the government section line controls the location of the northern boundary of the Big Horn Tract\u201d.<br/><br/>The real issue behind the decision in this case is equity and not intent as the court stated \u201crelying on previous decisions, courts have given surveyors guidance in the resolution of problems.<br/><br/>Three basic elements which have been identified are:<br/><br/>[i]1) An occupancy right that has ripened into a legal right extinguishes or becomes superior to all written title to occupied land.[i/]<br/><br/>2) As between private parties in a land dispute, a senior right is superior to a junior right.<br/><br/>3) Written intentions of the parties are paramount.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Judes had built a cabin on part of the land in dispute. If you read the pleadings and briefs in this case it is obvious this was a consideration in the decision to uphold the bench trial judgment. The facts are in the latter part of 1994, the Judes began construction of a cabin on the now disputed parcel identified as Tract 1, COS 1898. After the construction of the cabin had already begun, the Judes learned that Boyne (now Olson) claimed ownership of Tract 1, COS 1898. Nevertheless, the Judes continued with the construction of the cabin. The completed cabin is a two story, two bedroom log structure with an attached garage. The cabin's foundation extends 33.15 feet into Tract 1, COS 1898.</p>\n<p>Despite this it is clear that in this case the court clearly does recognize the difference between the original surveyor and a retracing surveyor.</p>\n<p>Another similar case comes to mind in [i]Rivers V. Lozeau No. 88-396, District Court of Appeal Florida, 1989 [i/] (2). However in this case the ambiguity involved the correct location of the line between two parcels of land lying within the 40 acre quarter-quarter section described as the Southeast 1/4 of the Southwest 1/4 of Section 15, Township 14 South, Range 24 East, in Marion County, Florida. In 1964, Joseph Rizzo and his wife owned that portion of this quarter-quarter section that is in question. The U.S. Forestry Service owns the land to the north. At that time, the Rizzos retained a surveyor, Moorhead Engineering, to survey their land and establish certain internal land lines dividing it into parts. Moorhead undertook to locate and monument Rizzos\u2019 external boundary lines and corners and to establish and monument the terminal points of certain internal division lines.</p>\n<p>The facts in this case are that \u201cin 1969, the Rizzos conveyed to Marcus E. Brown and wife by deed containing the following land description:</p>\n<p>The North 400.00 feet of SE 1/4 of SW 1/4 of Section 15, Township 14 South, Range 25 East, Marion County, Florida.</p>\n<p>The west, north, and east lines of the Brown parcel followed the outer or external boundary lines of the property owned by the Rizzos. The south line of the Brown parcel did not follow any internal line established by the Moorhead survey. Mr. Rizzo showed Marcus Brown the monuments Moorhead had set as being the north corners of this quarter-quarter section and certain other Moorhead monuments which the Rizzos told Marcus Brown were 33 feet south of the south line of the parcel the Rizzos conveyed to Brown. Later in 1977 or 1978, Marcus Brown measured 33 feet north of the Moorhead monuments shown him by Mr. Rizzo and placed a metal rod at the point Mr. Rizzo had told him was his south boundary line. Marcus Brown conveyed this property by the same description to George Brown who conveyed by the some description to appellees Raymond S. Lozeau and his wife.</p>\n<p>In 1975, the Rizzos conveyed a parcel of their remaining land to Paul W. Adams and wife, which parcel was described by reference to the boundary lines of this quarter-quarter section with the north line of the property being described as:</p>\n<p>thence N 89d53'01\" E along a line 400.00 feet south of and parallel to the North line of said SE 1/4 of SW 1/4 a distance of 1327.04 feet to a point on the East line of said SE 1/4 of SW 1/4;</p>\n<p>Using substantially the same land description, the Adamses conveyed to Daniel E. Reader and wife, who conveyed to appellants Harold J. Rivers and wife.</p>\n<p>In 1982, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management did a \"dependent resurvey\" of the lands of the U.S. Forestry Service which retraced the lines of the original government survey and identified, restored, and remonumented the original positions of the corners of the original U.S. government survey [*1]. This remonumenting of the original government survey, along with the 1986 survey by Whit Holley Britt, made obvious to all the true location of the north line of this quarter-quarter section on the ground and that the Moorhead monuments intended to denote that line were actually located 28.71 feet north of the true location of that line as it was originally established by the official U.S. government survey and reestablished by the 1982 government \"dependent survey.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Appellees Lozeaus brought this action in ejectment and for declaratory judgment against the appellants Riverses who had possession of the south 28.71 feet of the north 400 feet measured from the north line of the quarter-quarter section according to the U.S. government (and Britt) surveys. The Lozeaus argued that they acquired legal title to the disputed land by virtue of the 1969 deed from Rizzo to Marcus Brown and the successive conveyances to them. The Riverses argued that Moorhead was the original surveyor and that his monuments on the ground controlled the location of the land subsequently conveyed by Rizzo, notwithstanding that \"later\" surveys, i.e., the government survey of 1982 and the 1986 Britt survey, may show the Moorhead monuments to have been error. After a non-jury trial, the trial court found that the property descriptions of the parties overlapped and ordered that the exact dimensions of the overlap be established and the overlapping property split evenly between the plaintiffs and defendants. The Riverses appeal and the Lozeaus cross-appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>The court stated that \u201cLAND SURVEYORS Although title attorneys and others who regularly work with them develop expertise as to land descriptions, the only professional authorized to locate land lines on the ground is a registered land surveyor. In fact, the definition of a leally sufficient real property description is one that can located on the ground by a surveyor. However, in absence of statute, a surveyor is not an official and has no authority to establish boundaries; like an attorney speaking on a legal question, he can only state or express his professional opinion as to surveying questions. In working for a client, a surveyor basically performs two distinctly different roles or functions:</p>\n<p>First, the surveyor can, in the first instance, lay out or establish boundary lines within an original division of a tract of land which has theretofore existed as one unit or parcel. In performing this function, he is known as the \"original surveyor\" <i>and when his survey results in a property description used by the owner to transfer title to property</i> that survey has a certain special authority in that the monuments set by the original surveyor on the ground control over discrepancies within the total parcel description and, more importantly, control over all subsequent surveys attempting to locate the same line.</p>\n<p>Second, a surveyor can be retained to locate on the ground a boundary line which has theretofore been established. When he does this, he \"traces the footsteps\" of the \"original surveyor\" in locating existing boundaries. Correctly stated, this is a \"retracement\" survey, not a resurvey, and in performing this function, the second and each succeeding surveyor is a \"following\" or \"tracing\" surveyor and his sole duty, function and power is to locate on the ground the boundaries corners and boundary line or lines established by the original survey; he cannot establish a new corner of a new line terminal point, nor may he correct errors of the original surveyor. He must only track the footsteps of the original surveyor. The following surveyor, rather than being the creator of the boundary line, is only its discoverer and is only that when he correctly locates it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Further the court said that \u201cORIGINAL LAND LINES When there is a boundary dispute caused by an ambiguity in the property description in a deed, it is often stated that the courts seek to effectuate the intent of the parties. This is not an accurate notion. The intent of the parties to a contract for the sale and purchase of land, both the buyer and the seller, may be relevant to a dispute concerning that contract, but in a real sense, the grantee in a deed is not a party to the deed, he does not sign it and his intent as to the quality of the legal title he receives and as to the location and extent of the land legally conveyed by the deed is quite immaterial as to those matters. The owners of a parcel of land, being the grantee under a patent or deed, or devisee under a will or the heir of a prior owner, has no authority or power to establish the boundaries of the land he owns; he has only the power to establish the division or boundary line between parcels when he owns the land on both sides of the boundary line he is establishing. In short, an original surveyor can establish an original boundary line only for an owner who owns the land on both sides of the line what is being established and that line becomes an authentic original line <i>only when the owner makes a conveyance based on the description of the surveyed line</i> and has good legal title to the land described in his conveyance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Again we see a clear understanding from the court of what an original surveyor is, however in this case the court also tells us there is a difference between the original surveyor and the first surveyor. To this end the court stated that \u201cUNITED STATES AS ORIGINAL OWNER AND ITS CADASTRAL ENGINEER Subject only to certain rights of individuals under Spanish grants, the United States became the owner of all land now in the State of Florida by virtue of a treaty with Spain dated Feb. 22, 1819 and ratified Feb. 22, 1821 and, as original governmental owner, caused Florida to be surveyed in accordance with a rectangular system of surveys of public lands adopted by Acts of Congress. The permanent seat of government having been established at Tallahassee, an initial point of reference was located nearby through which a north-south guide line was run according to the true meridian and a base (township) line was run east-west on a true parallel of latitude. North-south range lines, six miles apart and parallel to the Tallahassee Principal Meridian, were run throughout the state except where impractical because of navigable water, etc. Likewise, East-west township lines, six miles apart and parallel to the base line, were also run throughout the state to form normal townships six miles square each of which were divided into 36 square sections, one mile long on each side containing as nearly as may be, 640 acres each. These sections were numbered respectively, beginning with the number one, in the northeast corner and proceeding west (left) and east (right) alternately through the townships with progressive numbers. Sections were divided into squares of quarter sections containing 160 acres. The quarter-quarter section corners are placed on the line connecting the section and quarter-section corners, and midway between them. [b]Although theoretically conceived and invisible, these lines are not merely theoretical concepts but are real lines, actually run and marked on the ground with terminal points monuments by surveyors acting under the authority of the cadastral engineer of the Bureau of Land Management. The approved and accepted boundary lines established by the federal government surveyors are unchangeable and control all references in deeds and other documents describing parcels of land by reference to the federal government of section, townships and range[i/]. The court also said that \u201cIn establishing the internal lines with Rizzo\u2019s subdivision, Moorhead acted as an \"original surveyor\" but in attempting to locate and monument Rizzo\u2019s external boundary lines which are described by reference to the federal rectangle system of surveying, Moorhead was a \"following surveyor\" and not only fail to properly find the northern boundary of this quarter-quarter section where it was located by the original government surveyor (and also re-established by an authorized federal government resurvey) but to evidence his erroneous opinion as to the true line, the Moorhead surveyor placed monuments 28.71 feet north of the true north line of this quarter-quarter section. From the time the federal government granted this quarter-quarter section to the original grantee down to the Rizzos, the title conveys was to a tract of land located according to the original government survey and by the deed from the Rizzos to Brown, and subsequent deeds, the Lozeaus acquired title to the north 400 feet of this quarter-quarter section according to the true boundary line established by the original government surveyors. This is true regardless of the fact that Mr. Rizzo showed Marcus Brown the erroneous monuments set by the Moorhead surveyors and regardless of where anyone erroneously thought of believed the correct location of this land boundary line to be. Neither the title to land nor the boundaries to a deeded parcel move about from time to time based on where someone, including a particular surveyor, might erroneously believe the correct location of the true boundary line to be. In 1975, the Rizzos conveyed to appellant Rivers\u2019 predecessor in title property the northern boundary of which is defined as being 400 feet south of, and parallel to the north line of this quarter-quarter section. Regardless of any assertion that this conveyance was made relying on the Moorhead survey, the description itself does not describe the line in question by reference to the survey or monuments set by the Moorhead surveyor. On the contrary, that description adopts by reference the true north line of this quarter-quarter section which is necessarily controlled by the location of that line as established by the original government survey. Even if the description in the subsequent deed is considered to overlap the south 28 feet of the property previously conveyed by the Rizzos to Lozeaus\u2019 predecessor in title (which it does not), it is quite immaterial because, at the time of the conveyance to Paul W. Adams, Mr. and Mrs. Rizzo did not own that south 28 feet, they having previously conveyed legal title to it to Marcus Brown, Lozeaus\u2019 predecessor in title. All else argues in this case is immaterial. The Lozeaus are entitled to prevail in this controversy\u201d.</p>\n<p>It is interesting in that in this case all legal theories that could change the result such as those relating to adverse possession, title by acquiescence, estoppel, lack of legal title, etc., were neither asserted, nor argued, nor material in this case.</p>\n<p>Texas has a number of cases dealing with this very issue and they all indicate a clear understanding of the difference between the original surveyor and the first surveyor (or later surveyor) who subsequently attempts to monument the original line created by that original surveyor. Examples of this can be found throughout case law in Texas and are too numerous to go in mention in depth for the purpose of this article. Some of these cases can be viewed at the Texas Board of Land Surveying website (3).</p>\n<p>The point is that surveying theory and practice are not based on some notion of surveyors alone nor does case law support a contention that there is no difference between the \u201coriginal surveyor\u201d and the \u201cfirst surveyor\u201d.\u00a0 In fact the contrary is quite evident with anything beyond cursory examination of case law.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Come

One day I just decided that this could not continue. I became hellbent on the idea that if we restructured the agenda of support and open the channels of communication, we could change and influence the future of an industry that a lot of executives would love to just have disappear. Proof of this can be realized when you consider just how many surveying publications refuse to mention us. They are afraid because we are the future of Surveying Media. \u00a0<a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com\" target=\"_self\">Land Surveyors United</a> is, as we all know by now, a hub for <em><strong>all things surveying related</strong></em>. \u00a0This means there will be at any given moment <strong>Surveying News</strong> pouring into LSU through various channels, engaged by our members and then poured back out into the world wide web as <em><strong>Surveyor's News</strong></em>. \u00a0Your participation on the network in the form of group discussions, <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/photo\" target=\"_self\">photos</a>, <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/video\" target=\"_self\">videos</a>, comments and sharing with others, <em>no matter how deep or shallow that may be</em>, becomes <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">news</span>. \u00a0This is just one of the many ways that LSU is completely different than any other website related to surveying. \u00a0I do not and will not restrict the subject matter of your content, provided it is <em><strong>in some way shape or form related to land surveying</strong></em>. \u00a0 \u00a0When you consider your membership from this perspective you may realize just how empowering this can truly be for the everyday surveyor. You have no boundaries. \u00a0Your language barriers have been removed and your cultural differences embraced. \u00a0You have the opportunity to learn anything you like from one another without limits and with this option, you can become a <strong>News Maker</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0In future posts I plan to explain in depth various ways to gauge and monitor your influence using LSU as your portal, how to maximize exposure of your surveying business using your profile and how to help other surveyors become better at what they do with what you share, while learning from them in turn. \u00a0In this post I will attempt to outline 3 aspects of becoming a news maker. \u00a0First we'll look at the <strong>difference between LSU and traditional surveying media</strong>. \u00a0Then I'll discuss a few <strong>simple ways for keeping up with activity and staying engaged</strong>. \u00a0Finally I'll touch on a few ways to <strong>further spread your contribution to the surveying industry outside of the LSU network</strong>. \u00a0<em>Lets begin.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 21px;\"><b><a href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/vibJJ-aJHN9M-Et3E9CsHITTvZ9KkFMEQADiYXQ-hkcQVNJmix97qGHuBUUHZ9t7UK3ydzd5Bw6LmM5MotTrHybuzfzW3XKg/newsmaker.gif\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/vibJJ-aJHN9M-Et3E9CsHITTvZ9KkFMEQADiYXQ-hkcQVNJmix97qGHuBUUHZ9t7UK3ydzd5Bw6LmM5MotTrHybuzfzW3XKg/newsmaker.gif\" class=\"align-center\" width=\"500\"/></a><br/></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><span class=\"font-size-4\">Ways To Consume and Respond to Surveying News</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/6eWaSyZn3VLixRBaBdWlefFgPZJgzuGY-r80SymzQgxRxuLdMi3nL-%20sVSU6SlvDW812un8Y0wm8OxHRpJVUqoYgOcXHfNrUR/filessvn_icon.png\"><img alt=\"road sign\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/6eWaSyZn3VLixRBaBdWlefFgPZJgzuGY-r80SymzQgxRxuLdMi3nL-%20sVSU6SlvDW812un8Y0wm8OxHRpJVUqoYgOcXHfNrUR/filessvn_icon.png\" title=\"Directions in News Making for Surveyors\" style=\"float: right;\" width=\"124\"/></a></p>\n<p>By now the majority of us are fully aware of how historically news in the land surveying industry has been made and distributed-most often involving lengthy descriptions of equipment specs that, if we were interested could find on the back of any product brochure- Usually crowded by advertisements of the latest robot, collector or device and <em>not often enough</em> written from the point of view of <strong>an actual land surveyor</strong>. \u00a0Therefore, in the past land surveying related news has been less helpful than we hoped it would be, bland, and void of true voice. \u00a0<em>Yet with no comparison, how would anyone ever know the difference?</em>\u00a0\u00a0This is not just my opinion but a general consensus that I have received over years of discussing the subject with <em><strong>actual surveyors</strong></em>. These days, all of this has changed. \u00a0<strong>Land Surveyors United</strong> is of course the forerunner for providing a place for the common everyday surveyor to actually <em><strong>become the news</strong></em>, for those who are just catching on. <em><strong>But how do we keep up with all of this streaming data and syndicated information?</strong> \u00a0<strong>Much less find a place to jump in and create something to share?\u00a0</strong></em>\u00a0\u00a0Participation on LSU is of course not surveying, but it has become one of the best places to discuss the theoretical perspectives of the who, what, when, why and how surveying can be performed. As time goes on, it will become the place on the web for a surveyor to go and use when he/she is not doing actual surveying. Here are a few ways to stay on top of hot topic in the network.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Official Land Surveyors Toolbar [find it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://landsurveyors.toolbar.fm\">here</a>]</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://storage.conduit.com/MarketPlace/74/b7f/749209d0-b9c3-49e9-9b1c-%201fa92750db7f/ToGo//634270439059981251/634270439059981251.png\"><img alt=\"portable surveyors social network\" src=\"http://storage.conduit.com/MarketPlace/74/b7f/749209d0-b9c3-49e9-9b1c-1fa92750db7f/ToGo//634270439059981251/634270439059981251.png\" title=\"land surveyors toolbar 2go\" style=\"float: right;\" height=\"51\" width=\"110\"/></a>This is the all around best solution for keeping track of everything which gets shared and discussed on Land Surveyors United in real-time, right from any browser. \u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://landsurveyors.toolbar.fm\">Just install it</a> and it does all of the work of importing and presenting the latest content on the network.

In the meatime, get all of your weather, tasks, mapping and online tasks accomplished easier and faster with this toolbar.</p>\n<p><strong>Joining Groups Based on a Topic or Location</strong></p>\n<p>When you join a <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/groups\" target=\"_self\">Support Group on LSU</a>, you are immediately on your way to customizing your own unique support network based on your general (or specific) location, a topic which you are passionate about or a type of equipment which you are either learning or have already mastered. \u00a0Your profile and network becomes more diversified and your influence grows according to your particular level of participation. \u00a0Everyone on LSU will have a unique combination of groups in which they belong and support. \u00a0\"Support\" in this sense involves the active willingness to add your opinion or perspective to a particular discussion related to a particular topic. \u00a0<strong>No matter what your perspective may be, the act of adding it to any discussion on LSU increases the likelihood of more participation from your fellow surveyors.</strong> \u00a0When new activity occurs within your groups, you receive notification via email and thus LSU gives you the \"heads up\" for another opportunity to voice your take on the subject. \u00a0The same occurs when you start a new discussion within a group- your fellow members within that group get notification of a new opportunity to go deeper with their opinions on said topic. \u00a0This is how we change this industry and the eliminate privatization of vital information which can harm a surveyor or even threaten ones job security. \u00a0Basically, sharing what you know best in land surveying, if done fairly regularly or often, can actually become a form of job security on Land Surveyors United. \u00a0This network gives surveyors the ability to become not only an authority on a subject, but perhaps even create a bit of fame in years to come due to consistent contribution to a specialized arena within the industry. \u00a0<strong>Very few companies will ever fire an industry expert.</strong> \u00a0If you put enough of your spare time into this network, you will become that expert. \u00a0So in effect, think about what you always considered to be job security, and flip it inside out.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in ways

I have engineered every aspect of Land Surveyors United to the best of my advancing ability in such a way that every single surveying related thought that crosses your mind becomes both news and an opportunity to support someone in a similar situation at some time in the future. Simply updating your profile status from the main page or on your profile page and letting us know the type of work you're doing from day to day will give other surveyors a better idea of the type of surveyor you are and what you specialize in.

Ive joked with Phil in the past about this...Mr. Stevenson (a self proclaimed \"dirt surveyor\") will have to die before anyone will be able to become more of an authority on Mobile Mappers. And even then, they have a lot of work to do. \u00a0He didn't set out to become an authority, <em>he just is the authority</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-4\"><strong>Do you use RSS feeds? Well Spread Your Activity Elsewhere Too</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you use RSS feeds on other sites such as your own, a facebook page, twitter etc. it is quite simple to actually syndicate your own activity and contributions to LSU by simply taking the feed URL for your profile and plug it in on another site. \u00a0For example, if you use netvibes (like the example service above in LSU Hub), you can add an RSS module to your own page and plug in one of the following addresses into the form where it asks you for a RSS feed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 <em><a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/events/event/feed?xn_auth=no&amp;user=%3CYOURSCREENNAME%3E\">http://landsurveyorsunited.com/events/event/feed?xn_auth=no&amp;user=&lt;YOURSCREENNAME&gt;</a>;</em></p>\n<p>For that matter, you can use the following URLs to RSS feeds on the network to share the entire network's activity in specific categories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0px;

Those surveyors will most likely find themselves Googling their questions and concerns only to find\u00a0<em><strong>your brilliant solution</strong></em>\u00a0on\u00a0<strong><em>our</em></strong>\u00a0network, having been answered years before by\u00a0<em><strong>some dead guy</strong></em>\u00a0who\u00a0<em>really knew what he was talking about</em>. Having seen and admired your post he'll read more about you and your contribution to surveying and become inspired. \u00a0He may ask to add you as a friend, but he can't because you are dead. \u00a0All he has to learn more from is what you took the time to share before you left. \u00a0Your explanations and detailed descriptions of life challenges as a surveyor inspire him to take his practice more seriously,sharpen his axe a little finer and find a tighter close in future loops. He'll know that land surveying isn't just a bunch of construction workers on the side of the road playing with lasers (<em>as my girlfriend would say</em>). It will start to become apparent that without the\u00a0<em>art of surveying</em>, there would have never been anything that could be called a\u00a0<em>surveying science</em>. Without some sort of personal theory regarding the importance of what we are doing, we're just turning angles and crunching numbers. \u00a0Our responsibilities begin much earlier in the morning than the first H.I. of the day.

They laid out 10's of thousands of \u00a0lots (today we call them subdivisions). Up until they began their work there was no ownership of title and location of title problems. The other amazing thing (to me at least) is that a very small percentage of those boundaries were ever contested. Consider Boston...the laying out of its original lots was begun in the early 1600's and by the time the United States came into being (1783) Boston had 10's of thousands of \"lot lines\" and tens of thousands of monuments. It is a very interesting anomaly to me that most of those boundaries were never contested until the mid 1900's when we surveyors, who could not find the original monuments, began to call building walls, fences, etc the only evidence of original boundaries. That, along with an \u00a0arrogance we developed with our more accurate measuring instruments and tools, made us decide we knew where the boundaries were...and justified it by saying \"the first surveyors used compasses and chains\" (More times than any of us would want to admit, I bet). We fail to remember that surveyors in those days were well aware of the inaccuracy of their measuring tools \u00a0AND SO THEY SET MONUMENTS....DO WE FORGET THE ORIGINAL MONUMENTS CONTROL? Measurements to the nearest second of arc and hundredth of a foot will never replace the original monuments, they simply define the mathematics of those monuments better.</p>\n<p>I admire and envy the Colonial surveyors.

Even when you are not logged on to the network, you can see the latest happenings on LSU right from this browser toolbar extension. \u00a0Then simply jump in when you have something to comment or suggest. In the meatime, get all of your weather, tasks, mapping and online tasks accomplished easier and faster with this toolbar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Joining Groups Based on a Topic or Location</strong></p>\n<p>When you join a Support Group on LSU, you are immediately on your way to customizing your own unique support network based on your general (or specific) location, a topic which you are passionate about or a type of equipment which you are either learning or have already mastered. \u00a0Your profile and network becomes more diversified and your influence grows according to your particular level of participation. \u00a0Everyone on LSU will have a unique combination of groups in which they belong and support. \u00a0\"Support\" involves the active willingness to add your opinion or perspective to a particular discussion related to a particular topic. \u00a0No matter what your perspective may be, the act of adding it to any discussion on LSU increases the likelihood of more participation from your fellow surveyors. \u00a0When new activity occurs within your groups, you receive notification via email and thus LSU gives you the \"heads up\" for another opportunity to voice your take on the subject. \u00a0The same occurs when you start a new discussion within a group-your fellow members within that group get notification of a new opportunity to go deeper with their opinions on said topic. \u00a0This is how we change this industry and the eliminate privatization of vital information which can harm a surveyor or even threaten ones job security. \u00a0Basically, sharing what you know best in land surveying, if done fairly regularly or often, can actually become a form of job security on Land Surveyors United. \u00a0This network gives surveyors the ability to become not only an authority on a subject, but perhaps even create a bit of fame in years to come due to consistent contribution to a specialized arena within the industry. \u00a0Very few companies will ever fire an industry expert. \u00a0If you put enough of your spare time into this network, you will become that expert.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in ways that you can

and an opportunity to support someone in a similar situation at some time in the future. Updating your profile status and letting us know the type of work you're doing from day to day gives us a better idea of the type of surveyor you are and what you specialize in. This gives us a pretty good idea of the types of questions \u00a0other surveyors can look to you for support.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>","createdDate":"2010-12-29T04:55:12.812Z","updatedDate":"2014-11-21T01:14:56.930Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2011-06-15T22:09:52.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:43244","contributorName":"0rc4n3qxpyxo6","description":"<p>whoa its like a whole new network...!</p>\n<p>thanks justin</p>","createdDate":"2011-06-16T03:16:07.199Z"}]},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:32781","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"sweet","description":"<p><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/oKWy6qkOvxOgorAkvadNfODbYw*XP-FHPpBYsCkJAptdxT*WPK5tUhyjGb-DzNn0Ns61IuZ0POTX5XpSKGbvv5AbWNvCaD4a/ABBR.html\"></a><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/padXlNpjawUVC0EVCelCxwXdDBPJ4aksS9tDw4NaW2h3i2V4nZY1ZveiGvTF2kDYmQ5FJMkaoKtlRx4n1jopde7Yi0bMguHe/accor.html\"></a><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/4vpHhMW54L70V-zIrftfQy-QeUoBsGvU2Hx6XUJ-cbeyqFC3XncSU1r2vWW9Le5VgvbnfHH*fkO3e36vKVS7uqrnwE3i8de7/cropbox.png\"></a><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/padXlNpjawW*vjXWXiHoeANKdXOXefkSz8WfJVN4D7bO0ElS6ti2f3nTCuEg9xvHXY88H6SS00JWsL*QhQRiZRGmQR0htqnw/accor.png\"></a><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/4vpHhMW54L4-zKK9tS*nWYjDkECm4faxa67OSjxOLB1LIXjcW5ECu72zXRLw0fveQz0MwWcjrwzg*nzsBrNDECKISdSKNfkl/accor.html\">accor.html</a><img class=\"align-full\" width=\"700\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/padXlNpjawW*vjXWXiHoeANKdXOXefkSz8WfJVN4D7bO0ElS6ti2f3nTCuEg9xvHXY88H6SS00JWsL*QhQRiZRGmQR0htqnw/accor.png\"/><img width=\"750\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/fNcXvO2BBMuP6XemfZJRnxPITA0U7v*q*WE54nRQRk2xy6fUhyoZB2mrfZUL**fjtDZ7pzUuZXtNk0GkTFJtjav1y6qn7FHM/cropbox.png?width=750\"/><img class=\"align-full\" width=\"750\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/4vpHhMW54L70V-zIrftfQy-QeUoBsGvU2Hx6XUJ-cbeyqFC3XncSU1r2vWW9Le5VgvbnfHH*fkO3e36vKVS7uqrnwE3i8de7/cropbox.png?width=750\"/>accor.html<a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/gvPxOsD-R*ONL0V*IMPCU2MU27bBRYMbki6uanRZKPq66YMUUSikQlKcoqj*AnTjSBWzq56P7C1vZ6gz*wTeLOf2X*2IK6Db/photobg.jpg\"><img class=\"align-full\" width=\"750\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/gvPxOsD-R*ONL0V*IMPCU2MU27bBRYMbki6uanRZKPq66YMUUSikQlKcoqj*AnTjSBWzq56P7C1vZ6gz*wTeLOf2X*2IK6Db/photobg.jpg?width=750\"/></a>ABBR.html</p>","createdDate":"2010-12-19T18:24:17.692Z","updatedDate":"2010-12-19T18:24:17.692Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"draft","publishTime":"2010-12-19T18:24:17.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:31867","contributorName":"2ihjx85n4v3dw","title":"Surveyors, Have You Claimed Your Business with Google?","description":"<p><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-weight: bold;\">I Am Going To Tell You How to <span>Future-Proof</span> Your Surveying Business</span><br/>If you have, you are among <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">the whopping 3% of business owners</span> in the world who has claimed their business on the Google maps and in Google Local Search.

So today let's talk about <b>what an effective How-To tutorial contains</b>. A 'How-To' tutorial is by far one of the most common <em>post types</em> used by almost every blogger, writer or expert online. <i>Why?</i> Because people search for answers when they don't have them already. Inherently, 'How-To' posts create limitless opportunities to not only bring tons of surveyors to the network, but ultimately they will <i>live forever</i> online and continue to help other surveyors til the end of time. A typical 'How-To' tutorial almost always promises to deliver a solution for the reader-but for the surveyor, it can also demonstrate the commonly overlooked \"know-why.\" Let's see how to create an attractive and supportive 'How-To' post that has the potential to enlighten and perhaps even change something in the industry as a whole on some level.</p>\n<div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/ua11aq*LquIsi9IS36cYX3uee5o00XGn-vfR9971Rx23MJ-NBL3QI9vQMndvf4jAtXK7sgp7odfda9xITiOuy4uLJpwhYQsA/howtohowto.jpg\"/></p>\n</div>\n<p><br/>\n<span id=\"fullpost\"><br/>\n</span></p>\n<h3><span id=\"fullpost\"><strong>Create Problem-Solver Article Which Will Withstand the Tests of Time</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span id=\"fullpost\"><br/>\nIdeally, every surveying related 'How-To' tutorial should be a <strong><em>problem-solver</em></strong> article, providing unique solution to some of the most common questions of those new to the industry. Anticipating readers' expectations and capitalizing on it will make you an ideal solution provider. Land surveyors want quick and easy solutions to their problems. Identifying your readers' grievances and providing the right answer to their questions in the form of 'How-To' posts can make your article a big hit in no time. This means more credibility for you as a professional and could be the beginnings of a terrific following. Just think..you could have surveyors all over the world utilizing your special techniques in the field.<br/>\n<br/>\n</span></p>\n<h3><span id=\"fullpost\"><strong>Craft Eye-Catching Headline</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span id=\"fullpost\"><br/>\nThe title of a 'How-To' post carries the weight of the whole article. You claim a solution, a promise in your post headline that tempts a visitor to read it. Headlines of such posts are like <strong><em>honey pots</em></strong> crafted to perfection to attract the audience. Having said that, one must keep in mind the negative implications of not fulfilling the promise done in the headline. The more eye-catching is your headline, the more responsibility is on your shoulders to match that headline with equally good content. Try not to bite off more than you can chew. When in doubt, break the tutorial into parts and indicate Part 1, Part 2, Part 3-when doing so, always finish what you started as leaving your readers hanging may destroy your good intentions you began with.<br/>\n<br/>\n</span></p>\n<h3><span id=\"fullpost\"><strong>Take Step-by-Step Approach</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span id=\"fullpost\"><br/>\nDivide the path towards the solution into clear steps and move ahead by taking one step (<em>no overlapping</em>) at a time. Sometimes, newbies are not able to pick up the right progress thread and mix different stages of solution at one place leading to confusion and frustration for the reader.<br/>\n</span></p>\n<div><span id=\"fullpost\">\u00a0</span><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span id=\"fullpost\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/9xjxY-XXh*ClciJdGd6URW6XeMusUneS4u279XLRiussn-1TLerik6N*uT2ukzuqK6FWarP9USsOzvaWKQYyQJ83S8qWKLKJ/stepbystepapproach.jpg\"/></span></p>\n</div>\n<p><span id=\"fullpost\"><br/>\nUse the power of <em>bullet lists, sub-headlines and short paragraphs</em> to make the tutorial clear enough to be grasped easily by anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\n</span></p>\n<h3><span id=\"fullpost\"><strong>Use The 'KISS' Principle</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span id=\"fullpost\"><br/>\nSurveyors love the KISS Principle. Remember, the solution provided by you is going to be read by intellects as well as by those who are completely ignorant of the subject discussed in the tutorial. Use the <strong>KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid)</strong> principle to make it readable for every class of readers. The more simple and plain is your 'How-To' tutorial language, the more it will be popular. Avoid use of rich complex terms that may confuse some of the readers.<br/>\n<br/>\n</span></p>\n<h3><span id=\"fullpost\"><strong>Spice Up With Illustrations</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span id=\"fullpost\"><br/>\nIllustrations are an essential part of any 'How-To' post. They add visual appeal and make the tutorial more readable and easier to understand. If there is scope, use them liberally to make your readers better understand the solution. You can always <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/photos\">upload the images</a> into Land Surveyors United and then use them in your post. <b>TIP</b>: When going this route, place a link to your tutorial in the description of the photo, so in the case a fellow surveyor finds the photo first, they can easily find what it relates to. Also remember that a How-To article related to doing something a certain way in one part of the world may be entirely different for surveyors in another location. So always remember to mention somewhere that 'this is how its done where you live.'<br/>\n<br/>\n</span></p>\n<h3><span id=\"fullpost\"><strong>Provide Supporting Resources</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span id=\"fullpost\"><br/>\nIf your 'How-To' post has the scope of providing demos or downloads, nothing can be better than that. For example, let's assume you are writing a 'How-To' tutorial about mapping a set of coordinates from a spreadsheet. Showing an example or even a couple of examples of the final result will do wonders for your readership. Package the code in a zip file and provide this download to your readers. They will simply love it and may spread the word about it among their contacts giving you more and more traffic.<br/>\n<br/>\n</span></p>\n<h3><span id=\"fullpost\"><strong>Be Ready To Answer</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span id=\"fullpost\"><br/>\nNo matter how well you package your solution, you are bound to be bombarded by readers questions in the form of comments and emails. Be mentally prepared and create some common FAQ's drafts to speed up your response. Sometimes, an average 'How-To' tutorial goes viral simply because you are answering every question of the readers. It may also happen that one of your readers provides a better solution then yours.

For that very reason, all blogs on LSU are referred to as \"<b>articles</b>.\"Nevertheless, by now all of us have at least heard about what a blog is. Today I am going to explain to you how blogging is a lot like land surveying and introduce a great service to those of you who actually may be maintaining a blog.<br/> <br/><div><u><b>Original Post:</b></u><br/><p></p>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SGk5bVOf9BI/AAAAAAAACVg/ovWhcMSBmz8/s1600-h/rsshugger.jpg\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SGk5bVOf9BI/AAAAAAAACVg/dyrCapq6xUI/s200-R/rsshugger.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></a></div>\n<br/>If you are serious about blogging and getting your word out (whatever that may be), <a href=\"http://www.rsshugger.com/\">RSShugger</a> is a new blog networking tool that may help you out. Blogging is all about time, energy and content. Its just one of those activities that you can either be serious about (because you have stuff to share) or it can be something one uses to pass the time and experiment with a virtual environment. Its a lot like surveying in many respects. You have those who play with a total station out on their new piece of land, turning angles while cracking beers and then there are those who live to stay on top of the newest technologies and techniques in order to further perfect their craft and career.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/search/label/surveyors\">Surveyors</a> , I've found are a difficult breed to reach out to,<i>in many ways</i>, and even harder to touch. <b><i>Why?</i></b> In a nutshell, it boils down to <strong>time constraints</strong>, <strong>lack of access to a computer</strong> during peak blogging times (when new information is coming out across the net) and a <strong>marginal lack of enthusiasm for web based technologies</strong>. <em>Hey, i don't blame you</em>. If I spent all day trying to figure out a busted data collector in the woods or a total station with zero instruction I'd be pretty tapped on learning energy too. I won't go into <em>all</em> of the reasons why surveyors have a hard time engaging with <a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/search/label/web%202.0\">Web 2.0</a>- that's exactly why I have built <a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/search/label/Land%20Surveyors%20United\">a whole social network</a> for you to find the info you need (<i>look no further than</i> <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com\"><i>Land Surveyors United</i></a> <i>to find the answer to many questions you may be seeking answers to</i>). I can't wait until the day (and oh yes, it is coming) when surveyors at large begin to realize the benefits of <a href=\"http://palmettoequipment.blogspot.com/search/label/social%20networking\">social networking</a> with others in the industry, start reading and sharing news from many sources, comment on other's blogs, share their knowledge and ultimately network to create a better industry for all. It will happen and I'm sure of it. In 2005-2006, I was on the virtual front lines when real estate professionals in NYC (and around the world) first began to discover the power of blogging. Today, the real estate industry bloggers are among some of the most followed publishers on the web. <b><i>Just jump in and speak your piece...believe me it becomes addictive.</i></b></div>\n<div><br/></div>\n<div>Just remember that blogging is an activity that shares a lot of similarities with surveying. You don't have to be an expert, <i>just interested</i> in the changes occurring in the world in respect to those things which you are most passionate about. If, in fact you are interested in starting or improving your blog, I will leave you with just one more hint: <b>RSS is now the backbone of all news everywhere</b>, so you might want to \"hug\" it, so to speak. It is the structure and method by which all information stands up and walks around. There are a gazillion ways to embrace the power of RSS (<i>yes, even for surveyors</i>) out there and <a href=\"http://www.rsshugger.com/\">RSShugger</a> is just one of those which make thespreadof your word possible.</div>\n<div><b>Experiment a little-don't be afraid!</b></div>\n<div><i>We'll get that damn data collector working in one way or another, together.

It also gives you a choice of three skins. Unlike other free calculators, its use is similar to the kind we do on paper. You can use it like a text editor and add comments or any other annotations to your calculations. The advantage of the tape style of calculations is that the calculations can be kept as records and even printed out. The calculator may not be suitable for power users but can be used to perform accounting operations.</p>\n<p>SFR Calculator (ver.4.0.6) is an 8.6MB free calculator download. It is supported on Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, and Windows 7.

It has a clean user interface and a very intuitive response to your inputs. SpeedCrunch calculates even as you type and this auto-completion behavior is quite handy when it comes to result speed. Results are precise up to 50 decimal points. Syntax highlighting also minimizes errors as you type. You can feed in formulas, constants, and functions from the extensive library that\u2019s available. SpeedCrunch supports unlimited range of alpha-numeric variables and it also lets you store your own for later use.

There are interactive tutorials which help you to start off with the app. SpaceTime has support for 2D and 3D graphing features. The scientific calculator has a large catalog of functions. The mathematical software covers algebra, computer algebra system (CAS), trigonometry, statistics (scatter plots, probability plots, histograms etc), and calculus among other capabilities. You can also enter your own scripts for solving loops, recursion and generating functions. Ultimately, you can capture screens, frames and results with a click.</p>\n<p>SpaceTime (ver.4.0) is a 1MB download. It is supported on Windows (2000, XP, Vista, and 7) and Mac OS X. SpaceTime can also be downloaded for the iPhone and the iPad (not free). SpaceTime requires an obligatory free registration for use.</p>\n<p>The five calculators cover the breadth from simplicity to complexity. The one you pick will depend on the level of calculations you need to perform. What\u2019s your view on the above five?

The application enables the user to record the location of assets and to enter information on attributes of assets in the field. The user also has the option of taking geo referenced photos and recording voice memos of assets and their attributes. Data collected can be wirelessly sent from the field in real time or downloaded when back in the office.<br/><br/>Field Assets provides users with a versatile asset management tool. The application enables data collection, mapping, voice recording and photography, all to be carried out using the one device. Field Assets can be utilized in a diverse range of enterprizes from natural resource management to property, utility or infrastructure management.<br/><br/>With the application users can:<br/><br/>* Set up their own unique fields to suit their individual project requirements.<br/><br/>* Verify their location and the location of an asset using the map screen.<br/><br/>* Enter information and record voice notes of assets and their attributes.<br/><br/>* Take geo referenced and date/time stamped photos of assets and their attributes.<br/><br/>* Share asset data between devices using peer to peer connectivity.<br/><br/>* Export their asset data via email, Arc2Earth, Twitter and the inbuilt Field Assets wifi server.<br/><br/>* Email SHP, Google Earth KMZ and CSV files to coworkers and clients.<br/><br/>* Display asset data on Arc2Earth.<br/><br/>* Display asset data on their own inbuilt HTML webpage.<br/><br/>* Download asset data as SHP, XML, SQL and CSV files via the inbuilt Field Assets wifi server.<br/><br/>\"Field Assets is an amazing tool for collecting any type of external data. Flexible, inexpensive and easy to use applications running on touch phones and tablets are the future in this area. By connecting this with an Arc2Earth Cloud, real time data in the field can be synchronized with local GIS applications in addition to many other online viewers. In our opinion, it's a really good match and the LBS Wireless team made it easy to accomplish quickly.\" Brian Flood, Arc2Earth.<br/><br/>#############################<br/>Field User Video <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fielddemo\">http://bit.ly/fielddemo</a><br/><br/>Get Started Video <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fieldassets\">http://bit.ly/fieldassets</a><br/>#############################<br/><br/><br/>Reviews:<br/><br/>* A clever, and innovative app from Down-under is likely the most feature-rich mobile GIS app yet... <br/><a href=\"http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/19597/28/\">http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/19597/28/</a><br/><br/>\" I survey for invasive plants and having the ability to add specific attributes to each asset is awesome.\"<br/>Plant Hunter<br/><br/>\" We collected 2 months of records of 25 weed species over 1,500 miles of roads.

When you're logged into your gmail account, look up\nin the top left of page and you'll see <b>Reader (you already have it if you have gmail)</b>. Google Reader allows you to\nsubscribe to changes and updates on a website without actually visiting\nthe site itself. All you have to do is \"subscribe\" to a website's feed\n(RSS feed) and from then on, all you have to do to see the latest updates\nis go to your reader and read them like email. The key is to go down\nthe list of new updates daily and when you see something new and\ninteresting, click \"Share it\"....this automatically shares your favorite\ncontent with everyone who is following you. This is also a great way\nto increase the importance of a page or a discussion on search engines\nbecause the more a piece of content is shared, the more importance it\nhas in the eyes of search engines. Below is a list of feeds that you\ncan add to your reader by simply clicking on the link and when it asks\nyou to subscribe, do so. Create a folder called \"LSU\" and add the\nsubscribed feeds to that folder for fast and simple reading and\nsharing. You can do this for virtually any page, group or discussion on LSU, even for individual members. Let me know if you have any trouble with this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;\">On Land Surveyors United, there are several types of feeds:</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

How have I been spending mine? I've been developing an alternative version of Land Surveyors United for iphones and ipads.</div>\n<div><br/><div>Now, when you visit LSU from your iphone or android, you will be automatically be redirected to the Iphone application/ mobile version of the network. I suspect in the up and coming months, this will be a useful feature to the network as many surveyors are beginning to use iphones in their daily work.</div>\n<div><br/></div>\n<div>I'm gonna make a small admission here and tell you that I personally do not have an iphone presently so my opportunities to test the interface are limited to friends and family encounters. Therefore <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/page/contact-support\">I have added a page to the network</a> for getting in touch with me to offer feedback and help me develop the application. So for those of you who have an iphone or android, please send me suggestions and help me test and add on to the application regularly, so as to get the application to a point of being both useful and easy to use from the field. I am also developing this application on my own in my spare time, and could enlist the help from a couple of developer associates when the time comes. They don't work for free so if you'd like to <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/page/donate-to-lsu\">donate to LSU</a> in order to help with the development of the application, please do so.

The idea is to make your brand \"sharable\" across the web and the goal is to have other members or businesses share your profile in ways similar to \"word of mouth.\" So lets look at some of the most important aspects of an attractive business profile for\u00a0<a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/\">Land Surveyors United</a>.<br/><br/><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span>Official Logo</span></span><br/><span>The most important feature of your profile, by far</span>. You should upload an official logo for your surveying company or business which is either already recognizable on the web or a logo which you plan to represent your business. Whatever this ends up being\u00a0<span>should be stuck with from this point forward</span>. Switching official logos confuses people in the long run.\u00a0<strong>When you prepare the image for upload try to have the logo in the dead center of a square so that the whole thing shows up in the profile box.</strong>\u00a0Upload it into your \"My Picture\" section of your profile. When other members recommend your business, this will travel with it. Also, it will represent your company anytime you leave comments on forums, write blog posts or run special promotions on Land Surveyors United.<br/><br/><span>Example:</span>\u00a0<span style=\"color: #cc0000;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profile/palmettoequipment\">Palmetto Equipment and Supply</a></span></span><br/></span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/w6r5HQTNwB6JAIJl4NidRqxNbM5eB*w0S6-Zkwa9G49oYzcH-hkC4MQKLecMUty*85IvVwEVfgA*M1JyT0-rLUEKygeU7g6L/black_logo_emblem.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span>Exact Location and Address</span></span><br/>Indicating your exact location in your profile is the second most important thing you can do to increase business. It is not only important for members to physically find you, but it is\u00a0<em>equally important for search engines to find you</em>, group your information with other relevant info about your business and show up in search results when people are searching for your type of business.<br/><br/><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span>Example:</span>\u00a0420 King Street, Charleston SC 29401</span><br/><br/><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span>Some examples of your products and services</span></span><br/>This is a terrific way to express creativity while giving other LSU members a way to visualize what it is that you do. Use the photo and video sections of the network to put examples of your products and services out there. You can, for example upload a set of photos, take the embed code and place the slideshow anywhere on the web. When someone clicks on that slideshow, it will bring them back to your profile on the network. Upload only your best and most relevant images and think of them as \"bait\" for your potential customers.\u00a0<span>TIP:</span>\u00a0You can also use this method for sharing group photos from your last event to show the world how much fun everyone is having.<br/><br/><span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Relevant Company Information</span></span>\u00a0<br/>As we say in the blogging world, \"<span>Content is King!</span>\" This means that the best and most relevant content of the web will always show up higher in search results than even the most expensive google adwords.\u00a0<span>How do you do this?</span><span>By making sure you have at least one paragraph on your profile full of keywords that relate to your business.</span>\u00a0You can type this in the \"text box\" section of your profile. You should upload at least one image in this box and under the \"options\" link on the photo upload box, check the box next to \"wrap text around image.\" This will produce a nice attractive description of your company with a visual representation for others to get a better idea of what you do. Your profile on\u00a0<span>Land Surveyors United</span>\u00a0should be customized to look like your existing website or for those who have no website, they should be designed with a color scheme and imagery that reflect the industry which you are involved.<br/><br/><span>Example:</span>\u00a0\"Here at Neighbor Design, we help small businesses and artists promote their products and services through web design, social media marketing and search engine optimization. If your website is not attracting new customers either because it can't be found or is difficult to navigate, we can show you how to make it much better on any budget. Just take a look at some of our client testimonials.......\"<br/><br/><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span>A Simple form of Contact</span></span><br/>Always Always Always leave the following 3 types of contact information on your profile:\u00a0<br/>Phone number<br/>Email Address\u00a0<br/>Website Address.\u00a0<br/>Those profiles which get the most traffic have this information 100% of the time.<br/><br/>If you ever have any questions about how to do this or need assistance, please do not hesitate to send me a<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profile/LandSurveyorUnitedAdmin\">message</a>.

This week we bring you something even more exciting! If you take a look at the sitewide toolbar up at the top of the network (click to expand it), you'll see that there have been some excellent new tools and enhancements added to better your experience on the network, including a store!<br/><font size=\"4\">Introducing the New and Improved Sitewide Toolbar</font><br/><br/><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/uwEU6DTJZ-Fc3AL3wgW1JwF23rPjuahWhNKcd*sfFs-BNpuFOpFQiR*1nJmvbUlO3gnS574458YC*ViqliGNoH4Qah1Xmst4/newlsutoolbar.jpg?width=721\" alt=\"New Toolbar for Surveyors\"/></p>\n<br/> <br/>\nList of New Tools for Surveyors<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\">Suggest a Link</span>- Suggest a link to be added to the Land Surveyors United directory, which is being compiled and will be offered next month to all of our wonderful members at no cost. This will be available on-line as well as in PDF booklet form.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;\">LSU Store</span>- Our new store has been an idea that I've been steadily working on for some time now. At first, we had planned on a store which offered paypal checkout options, but found that paypal is both limiting and has security flaws which many surveyors just do not have the time to deal with. So, instead I've created the first ever toolbar store which loads on top of any page on the network (just like the picture above) and allows you to add items to a cart and when you're ready to checkout, will take you strait to a secured checkout page on Google's servers where you can pay for your items with any credit card, check or money order. Paypal options are still available by request.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\">LSU Member Map</span>- You can open this version of the member map (which has also been updated in the usual spot) right on top of any page in the network for quick reference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;\">Translate</span>- The translation tools have been moved to the toolbar to maximize the screen real estate here on the network. You can still translate the network into over 143 languages. In the near future, I will be creating dedicated version of LSU into selected languages for out international members.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\">United States Surveyors</span>- You may have <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blogs/surveyorshow-do-you-represent\">read that Land Surveyors United has social support groups for each of the 50 states</a> of the US. If you happen to be an LSU member living in the United States, please choose the state in which you belong and join that group. Doing so will allow us to move into the next phase of development. As groups grow, I will be adding location-based enhancements to each group to better support surveyors in the respective areas. Our next phase is to roll our support groups dedicated to the outer-lying islands and provinces of the US. Then we move to Europe and Asia. Keep an eye on this toolbar as is grows increasingly useful to surveyors across the globe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\">Social Media</span> Stay on top of all social media discussions within and outside of Land Surveyors United right from the toolbar, where you can access the LSU Facebook Page, Twitter and even share information and content with the group.<br/><br/><br/><font style=\"font-style: italic;\" size=\"5\">How can You Help LSU to Grow?</font><br/><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">That's simple.</span> Become more active and share tips and tricks that other surveyors around the world need to succeed. You never know how useful that manual sitting on your hard drive or that equipment tutorial video you have could be to a surveyor in need. Thousands of surveyors visit LSU every week looking for help using equipment and software. Simply start a discussion and upload what you have with a short description...someone will find it valuable life saver and you become hero for a day! <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Simple as that!</span> I look forward to your contributions to Land Surveyors United.<br/><div id=\"seolinx-tooltip\" style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);

One of the exciting new additions is the Official Land Surveyors United Community Toolbar, which can be added to your browser <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/page/lsu-toolbar\">by visiting this page on LSU</a>. This toolbar sits at the top of your browser and will allow you to handle all sorts of tasks and keep up with discussions on the network without having to even visit the site! <br/><br/><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/7NZYLygCSczU54--o*cHpNvzkZhi*3jL4mpgRlHmjOTKlBXXPCAoQJ37pYY19IpkgEUgAP4Z7qb65hLqm5iyTm0696m*KX7a/lsutool.png?width=721\" alt=\"land surveyors toolbar\"/></p>\n<br/><br/><font size=\"4\">Ok...So What Does this Toolbar Do?</font><br/>I've been thinking long and hard about the types of tools that land surveyors need when surfing the internet for answers and have come up with a few tools that seem virtually necessary across the board. The <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Official Land Surveyors Toolbar</span> will allow you to track the latest forum discussions and blog posts, keep up with your messages and comments and search the entire LSU network including document libraries right from your toolbar, no matter what site you are on.<br/><br/><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/eyZ9Pw6YQel9X9DnyejT1YnX*n-RUFIPgjdqSe9pgIl1hlwwjna--BgHD7aZ4WjzDCmXXkvs*AP5CiR8l6F1uuETdpY-pS7B/toolbarstuff.png?width=721\" alt=\"surveyors toolbar features\"/></p>\n<br/><br/><br/><font size=\"4\">How can I Personalize My Toolbar?</font><br/>At the present time, there are quite a few personalizations you can make to your toolbar, such as weather for your area, email retrieval, facebook and twitter login, etc. In the very near future, you will have access to all of your LSU inbox, friends, photos and settings right from the toolbar, even when you are not logged on the actual site. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Here is how you do this:</span><br/><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/*hG0ZQZ6D4*zeQRuu9DEScXmg4o0TOKZkNfPMK0DAC6mwYPZHVFqoV7D06hQUmtJVeX0Hweo-ApdkNu*7mw*xqkKl1odEwrZ/toolbarstuf2f.png\" alt=\"personalizing your land surveyors toolbar\"/></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><font size=\"5\">Where Do I get The Land Surveyors Toolbar?</font></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Funny you should ask!

That is an application which can be added to your toolbar at any time which allows you to take that information with you wherever you go.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/JQ*kfiVOm*nD-kpkQ33GRUPbiGb6Fl1eTddVvU61Qm*LejQOFDWAHxBK2V5TYrsN8xbjNJjTLnqUIIlp3hSE6qJT04-1M8pX/app.jpg\" alt=\"LSU 2go\"/></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just click on an App and off you go!

Upon a little inspection one might see that the two products share a little more than just three letter name similarity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<table style=\"height: 160px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Sokkia SRX</th>\n<th>Cadillac SRX</th>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>cable- free</td>\n<td>should have cable, but doesn't</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>remote control driven</td>\n<td>starts by remote control</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>auto-tracking</td>\n<td>one word: Northstar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>auto-pointing</td>\n<td>GPS comes standard</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>robotic</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">this car practically drives itself</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Just take a look at some of the features that <a href=\"http://www.sokkia.com/Products/Detail/106.aspx#\">Sokkia's SRX</a> comes packing for just a little over $20k:<br/> <br/></p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SJiOSSucwJI/AAAAAAAADGg/mXQxQQj6GJs/s1600-h/similaritiesSRX.jpg\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SJiOSSucwJI/AAAAAAAADGg/agBJGP3qD5M/s320-R/similaritiesSRX.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SJiW_Gm1mxI/AAAAAAAADHA/sYxuAf1Db9I/s1600-h/sokkialogo.jpg\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WofhhEQ1aD0/SJiW_Gm1mxI/AAAAAAAADHA/vjag1zpn4hw/s320-R/sokkialogo.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></a></div>\n<p>Is it just me or could Sokkia just as easily be selling a car here?

I know, I know. Groan-Sigh-Hiss. Sounds downright painful for those of us that consider the internet to be free and fun. The fact of the matter is, those who tell you this sort of stuff have made it a business to recruit you to do such things. Its unfortunate that learning new ways of doing business are so tough, yet the only way to survive in the age of the internet is to have a strong presence on the internet.</span><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif; line-height: 19px;\"><br/></span><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif; line-height: 19px;\"><br/><b>But here's the thing.</b> The business world in general just flat out <i><u>does not get it</u></i> (not just the surveying world) . Most are completely dumbfounded by the thought of <i>thousands or millions</i> of people saying whatever they want, when they want to say it and how they want to say it. You've got <i>supposed</i> support networks who ask you to post or comment on anything that you like, yet if that comment happens to link to a resource or product that brings no money to the forum owner, chances are it will be deleted. Chances are, an advertisement will be put in its place.

They want you to be the racecar while they drive you as fast as possible. I have (unfortunately) taken time to attend <i>a few</i> social networking events and webinars which claim to teach the <i>proper ways</i> to do this and that and I'll be the first to tell you that the majority of these functions are <u>complete crap</u>. My goal for attendance was to attempt grappling a few tips that might be applied here on LSU to make surveyor's lives more simple. The fact of the matter is, most of us feel that either our lives are as simple as we could already make them or they are going in so many hectic directions that the just has to be a simpler way. <u>This is how they get you</u>. Nevertheless, when it comes down to it, there is nothing a person can tell you about your own business which you do not already know-and if there is, it is <i>up to you</i> to do the research and find out what that is on your own time. You learn social networking <i>by trial and error</i> and learn best when you just be yourself and avoid the teachings of so-called gurus who want to teach you how to use facebook, provided you give them $199.95 <b><u>You walk away with nothing. They walk away with your money adding no value to your business.</u></b> Each of these so-called lecturers will tell you how oh-so-very important it is to <i>control</i> the message. They'll go on and on about how Businesses must be involved so that they can control what is said and censor it if necessary, so that their product or service would not be seen in a bad light. If your product sucks, I want to tell you and the world about how bad it sucks and let my friends know so they don't get burned too.</span><div><font class=\"Apple-style-span\" color=\"#003399\" face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" size=\"3\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><font class=\"Apple-style-span\" color=\"#222222\" face=\"'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif\" size=\"3\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><br/></span></font></span></font></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif; line-height: 19px;\"><br/>Yes, I know what you are thinking (and I agree). \"Well that's totally stupid.\" Social Networking is dependent on being viral.

Probably not on the level that the gurus above are thinking, but Governments can and will block the transmission of thoughts and ideas. Nevertheless, if you consider the fact that we ARE the Government, there still may be a chance to keep the internet and the resources that we need to survive free. But we have to start working on it.

Instead of businesses trying to censor others-their ideas and thoughts; why not get into the mix and deliver your companies message in human terms? In other words, in an easy to understand language...why not use the viral aspects of Land Surveyors United, YouTube, Vimeo, Flickr and hundreds of other Web 2.0 (and 3.0) services to get YOUR message out. Why not? You don't need to pay huge advertising firms to broadcast your message! <i>After all, who can describe what you do better then you?</i> The platform is here and the process has been simplified for you already. You can both control your company's message and promote it virally right from the comfort of your own profile on LSU. Just update your status a few times a week-write a blog post with visual imagery about your business and what you do as surveyors-make a company video and upload it to the network-start a discussion and share some valuable resources with others. Your company will start to take a whole new direction and your phone will start ringing again. I guarantee it!</span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif; line-height: 19px;\"><br/></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif; line-height: 19px;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: large;\">What Will The Surveyors of the Future Have to Work From?</span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif; line-height: 19px;\"><br/></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif; line-height: 19px;\">In ten-fifteen years, there will be no more surveyors on earth who know the art of chaining, no wise and weathered leaders who can teach you how to calculate property values with a slide-rule and no one who can tell you how to use a gammon reel. In order for these skills to be passed on to the next generation, you have to stop thinking about them as trade secrets, but rather as good content, infinitely useful to a beginner and reading material for the future surveyors to use when trying to better understand where the technology that they are using came from. If you want to truly live past your death and contribute something helpful and useful to the land surveying industry, the best thing you can do is promote yourself by sharing those tricks and tips that have gotten you to where you are today. Start discussions with other surveyors and work the many aspects of those discussions out with dialog and details. <br/><br/>A message to gurus and big businesses trying to control the surveying industry: <b>Save us all a lot of trouble and stop trying to control us.</b> You've got a product. Let us help you sell it. Put it out there and let it go free...free as a bird. I promise that not only the industry will prosper, but your businesses will be better off in the future as well. At the end of the day, a surveyor is going to do what he/she is most comfortable with doing and that usually involves a small consensus among peers. Surveyors know what is best for themselves and their families-there is nothing you can convince them of otherwise. Yes, social networking in todays world is very important to business, but the level at which sharing information becomes useful is only relevant to the individual. The missing link is the person and what they feel is worth sharing.</span><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif; line-height: 19px;\"><br/></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif; line-height: 19px;\">Ok..i'm stepping down from my soapbox...<i>does anyone have anything that they would like to add?</i></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","createdDate":"2010-08-08T20:45:55.150Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-10T09:35:53.868Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2010-08-08T20:45:55.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:124565","contributorName":"3i7uq8ojnbaej","description":"<p>Perhaps, if we write a book about this,b something a bit more tangible, to hold in the hand, without electricity, the generation that is about to pass on their businesses to their sons and daughters, will realize that the online presence of a company or person is a reality, a reputation, a potential for reinforcing credentials and experience, a hub for a client base, and an opportunity for an extended client base.

The idea here is to create a place for every surveyor in the United States (<em>and eventually the globe</em>) to go and have <strong>all of their state based information</strong> <em>all in one place</em>-including the most up to date documents and events from their state board. And because state board websites (with the exception of a few) are for the most part out dated and operate like they were built in 1985, these groups give surveyors from each state a way to track important news, communicate with others in their state in a discussion format and create state-based events for others to attend.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><font size=\"5\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: mceinline;\">The Next Step Involves You</span></strong></font></h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the links below you can click on the state name and find other surveyors in your state and the link beside the state is for the new state based social support group. I am currently seeking a few <strong>super surveyors</strong> (LSU Party Chiefs)who would like to take charge of their state and invite other surveyors from their state to join and become active. Also, if you would like to change the background image of your state to something other than the state flag, simply upload a photo to LSU with the title \"{State Name} Group BG\" or drop it into a discussion on that state's dedicated discussion board. I styled the groups to be simple yet identifiable for each state, but left the opportunity for 100% customization of each state open for you the members to choose. In the very near future, there will be a revenue sharing incentive for group moderators who recruit new members from their state. Group moderators will receive an official seal of \"LSU Party Chief\" to display on their profile and will become featured for their state.</p>\n<h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node S01t02sP\">United

I had a chance to catch up with Clay briefly to ask a few questions and this is what I got:<br/>\n<br/>\n<hr/><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Do you have any background experience as a land surveyor? If so, how long did you survey?</span> <em><span style=\"font-family: mceinline;\">Nope, no experience as a surveyor. I just really liked the profession as a concept because I wanted my characters to be smart but also work in a non-office setting where they'd have plenty of time to chat without being harassed by a boss. Plus, I couldn't think of anyone else doing a show around this genre of work.</span></em><br/> <br/> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Do you have plans for more episodes of Surveyors of Land?</span> <em><span style=\"font-family: mceinline;\">I actually do have plans for more episodes. The next one is recorded and waiting to be animated. And the story for the episode after that has been roughly outlined.</span></em><br/> <br/> <br/> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">One my my favorite aspects of the cartoon is that the guys never get around to actual surveying. Will the guys ever actually survey any land? If so, we could incorporate some surveying jargon and real life industry stuff that is comical</span>. <em><span style=\"font-family: mceinline;\">The guys will eventually get back to work, whether or not they actually get some surveying done remains to be seen. The one character, Burt, is meant to be a 5th generation surveyor so he'd be more likely to say something semi-professional sounding -- again it would just depend on where the episodes go and ultimately if I thought I could make it funny. But again, love hearing suggestions -- especially cool from actual surveyors. Please encourage LSU members to send me anything they think might be funny enough to work into the series.</span></em><br/> <br/> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anything you want to ask me or the group?</span> <em>The only thing I'd ask is that I'm pretty much working on word of mouth here, so if you have friends or family that you think might get a chuckle out of this please forward it. The more eyes on it the better -- keeps encouraging me to do more!</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<hr/><h3>Check out some of the Episodes Here on LSU:</h3>\n<br/><h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node S02u02fp\"><a href=\"../../video/surveyors-of-land-episode-9\" class=\"title\">Surveyors Of Land - Episode 9: \"Makin' Stuff\"</a></h3>\n<h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node S01u01hE\"><a href=\"../../video/surveyors-of-land-episode-8\" class=\"title\">Surveyors Of Land - Episode 8: \"Pad Crash\"</a></h3>\n<h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node S01u02ms\"><a href=\"../../video/surveyors-of-land-episode-7\" class=\"title\">Surveyors Of Land - Episode 7: \"Lunar Rainstorm\"</a></h3>\n<h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node\"><a href=\"../../video/surveyors-of-land-episode-6\" class=\"title\">Surveyors Of Land - Episode 6: \"Love Cot\"</a></h3>\n<h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node S01u01ys\"><a href=\"../../video/surveyors-of-land-episode-5\" class=\"title\">Surveyors Of Land - Episode 5: \"Eagle Angel Lady\"</a></h3>\n<h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node S01u012s\"><a href=\"../../video/surveyors-of-land-episode-4\" class=\"title\">Surveyors Of Land - Episode 4: \"New Moves: Part 2\"</a></h3>\n<h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node S01u01sE\"><a href=\"../../video/surveyors-of-land-episode-3\" class=\"title\">Surveyors Of Land - Episode 3: \"New Moves\"</a></h3>\n<h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node S01u02to\"><a href=\"../../video/surveyors-of-land-episode-2\" class=\"title\">Surveyors of Land - Episode 2: \"The Bush District\"</a></h3>\n<h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node\"><a href=\"../../video/surveyors-of-land-pilot-1\" class=\"title\">Surveyors of Land - Pilot</a></h3>\nSpread the word about this awesome series and feel free to send Clay any ideas that you might have for funny future episodes.

Naturally, most land surveyors are more comfortable with the technical and creative aspects and less comfortable with running a business. While you do need to have some capability to run the business, you do not need to be a business guru to be an effective and efficient land surveyor.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">Part of the struggle from the business aspect involves knowing how to encourage clients to use your services when there are a million other options out there. In this post we\u2019ll take a look at the subject of competition for land surveyors, and discuss some things that you can do to thrive in this competitive industry.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 30px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; width: 646px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; clear: both; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">1. Embrace the Competition</span></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">Although this is an industry that is filled with \u201ccompetitors,\u201d the nature of the community of land surveyors is completely different than that of most other industries. Surveyors generally are very approachable and other service providers aren\u2019t usually viewed as competition. Take the time to get to know others who are offering similar services, whether they are owners of a company, employees of a firm, or members of an in-house crew.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">There are a number of significant benefits to embracing the competition and making friends in the industry. First, there is a lot to be learned from other surveyors. Most surveyors do not attempt to protect the secrets to their work, but they do recognize when others are putting their secrets into practice. There is plenty of information freely available through books, magazines, and online tutorials that will allow you to learn from those who could easily be viewed as your competitors.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">Second, a lot of referrals are passed on to clients for other land surveyors to pick up. When a crew is too busy to take a particular project or when it is not a good fit with the type of work that they do, it is not uncommon to refer the client to a friend or contact that may be able to help. Of course, if you are not connected to others in the industry you will not be getting these types of referrals.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">Third, everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. If you are working independently as a one man crew you will not have the resources at your disposal that you would have if you worked at a larger agency. You won\u2019t have co-workers who excel in certain areas that you can turn to for a quick question or some advice. In these cases, if you are friendly with others in the industry you may be able to get some assistance when needed. And of course, you\u2019ll also be able to help others when the situation arises.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 30px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; width: 646px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; clear: both; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">2.

Knowing what you do best and exactly what you have to offer will make this a lot easier. Ideally, your potential clients will be looking for something that is a good fit for your talents and experience.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">Take a look at the situation from the client\u2019s perspective. Why should they hire you? What can you do for them that others cannot? Once you\u2019ve seen these things from the client\u2019s perspective it will be much easier to communicate with them in a way that will put your best foot forward.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 30px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; width: 646px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; clear: both; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">3.

What you can control is <i>your own skill levels and knowledge</i>. Land Surveying is an industry that requires continual improvement in order to stay on top of new technologies and to avoid simply following the trends. Rather than getting down about all of the other surveyors out there, focus on your own abilities and what you can do to improve them. If you are constantly improving yourself you are moving in the right direction.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-xg-p: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 25); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">Making yourself better at what you do will obviously help you to attract more clients and to overcome the challenge of dealing with competition.

Personal letters are helpful. However, given the strength of numbers and the focus on the economy, you are encouraged to write on behalf of a business or professional organization if you can do so. You can focus on any topic that is important to you. The following are some historical and present information that you can consider when preparing a letter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe SVT program at the University of Maine is the only ABET accredited four-year surveying degree program in New England. Thirty years ago the land surveyors of all six New England states had a vision of designating one university in New England to offer a BS in land surveying, while each individual state would designate at least one college to offer an AS in land surveying. Their thought was that students could get their AS in land surveying at their state school. Those graduates of the two-year program that excel and desire to continue their studies in surveying could then transfer to the four-year program as juniors. Over 20 colleges and universities in New England submitted proposals to become the only school to offer a four-year BS in land surveying. The University of Maine was selected by the New England Surveying organizations. For more than 20 years this system has been successful. University of Maine graduates are now senior managers, owners, or principals of large and small surveying companies throughout New England and the United States. The SVT program typically has students from every New England state who transfer in as juniors after getting an AS from their local surveying college. To weaken or destroy the four-year program at the University of Maine will destroy this successful system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn ABET accredited degree is required for licensure as a land surveyor in many states, with many states expected to adopt this requirement in the future. For years, New England Boards of Registration of Land Surveyors have been considering requiring that all applicants have a BS in land surveying. In 2008-2009, Mane surveyors learned that the US Dept of Labor ruled that they were not members of a \"learned profession\" because Maine state statutes do not require surveyors to have a four-year degree in land surveying to be licensed. Maine surveyors challenged that ruling and lost. If and when the six state Boards of Registration of land surveyors require that applicants have a BS in land surveying, the students would have to go out of New England to go to school to get a BS in land surveying. This will be a serious blow to the land surveying profession in New England. (Referring to Gibson's January 2010 article in Professional Surveyor.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least two faculty are almost certainly required for ABET accreditation. Therefore, the SVT program will almost certainly lose ABET accreditation if there is only one full-time faculty member. At the present time, Ray Hintz is 100% SVT, Carlton Brown is 75% SVT and 25% CMT, and Knud Hermansen is 25% SVT and 75% CMT for a total of two full time SVT faculty. As our numbers grow, an additional faculty will be necessary \u2013 not the loss of an existing faculty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second SVT faculty position was guaranteed by a contract between the University of Maine and the Surveying Educational Foundation of New England (SEFNE) based on number of students in the program and the donations provided by SEFNE. The number of students continues to be satisfied, and the donations have been exceeded. Accordingly, the elimination of one SVT faculty would appear to be a breach of this agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe SVT program, faculty, and students have made significant efforts to work with the profession. Consider some of the tangibles from this close relationship: SVT has received donations in excess of $100,000 toward the University of Maine Foundation for use in various named SVT scholarships. SVT has a funded foundation account in excess of $50,000 for a photogrammetry lab thanks to SEFNE. SVT has received vendor support in excess of $200,000 off retail prices in support of laboratory equipment and software. SVT faculty provide more than 20 seminars annually to federal, state, and private organizations. 98% of SVT graduates stay in New England and most of those participate in or own small businesses at some time during their professional careers. Many graduates serve on licensing boards, professional society executive committees, and professional committees.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe SVT program has provided an educational home to students from Saudi Arabia who wish to study surveying. These students supported by ARAMCO and pay considerable tuition to the University of Maine. The surveying program had several ARAMCO graduates in the past and currently have three enrolled in the program. SVT has hopes of doubling that number in the fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently the student to faculty ratio in SVT exceeds 30:1. This is above the maximum recommended by ABET accreditation standards. At this time, the School of Engineering Technology where the SVT program resides generates sufficient tuition from enrollment to pay for faculty salaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, it is commendable that SVT graduates get well-paying jobs that aid the economic growth of the state and region. It is hard to imagine economic growth that does not involve the profession of surveying. In a normal economy, many graduates will receive two and three different job offers. Even now, there are employment offers being made to students. The average starting salary of graduates is often in excess of starting salaries of teachers and far in excess of Liberal Arts graduates. Over the life of the alumni, the above average earning potential of the surveying graduate will add considerably to state revenue through income taxes alone. In simple terms, surveying students are good investments for the state to improve the economy and lead to economic growth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ll close by encouraging you to write a letter and advocate for the SVT program. Your help will be appreciated. The letters need to be received prior to April 23.</blockquote>\nThank you for your help and please pass this information on to all the surveyors and/or alumni you know so that they can also contact the University of Maine to keep the SVT program fully funded and intact.","createdDate":"2010-04-18T02:00:15.174Z","updatedDate":"2016-05-21T15:25:37.607Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2010-04-18T02:00:15.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:17486","contributorName":"2ihjx85n4v3dw","title":"Two New Tools For Interested Land Surveyors and Engineers","description":"The position of the sun is very important for nearly every land surveying job.

It assumes you are familiar with the way in which the SDR33 works. It is well worth your time to become familiar with the SDR33, it can make your surveying much more efficient.</p>\n<p>There are two small \"camera\" batteries. These should be installed first. Make sure you get them in the correct way. Then install two 9v batteries. Always make sure that you have a spare set of 9v batteries before you go to the field. The camera batteries will maintain data stored in memory if the 9v batteries run out, but they cannot run the SDR33. Never be store batteries in the data recorder since it will constantly draw power from them, even when off, to maintain memory. Remove all batteries when done with the data in the recorder.\u00a0<em>Check that you have downloaded all data before you remove the batteries!</em>\u00a0The best method is to manually delete the surveying jobs. You can only delete a job if it has been downloaded.</p>\n<p>You should run through the following setup each time you use the SDR33. People using the data recorder before you may have used different settings.</p>\n<p>Systematically move down the Function menu, starting with the\u00a0<em>Job Menu item</em>. Check that each field is the way you want it. I would suggest checking the settings even if you were the last person to use the data recorder.</p>\n<p>Turn the data recorder on. If you do not get to the screen with the Functions menu, either press the button, or press the F1 key (this is the FUNC softkey). The following is a rundown of the Function menu items. The options for each field are explained in the SDR33 manual. Below are suggested settings, and where appropriate I have made some suggestions on which settings to use.</p>\n<h2>Job</h2>\n<p>Specify a job name, or select a pre-existing job name. To select a pre-existing job, just highlight the name and press OK. To define a new job, press the \"New\" softkey (F1).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When defining a new job, you will be asked to fill out the following items</li>\n<li><em>Job</em>: Specify a name</li>\n<li><em>S.F.</em>: Leave this set at 1.00000000000. This scale factor can be used to reduce you measurements to a plane coordinate system.</li>\n<li><em>Point Id</em>: Usually use \"Numeric\". This used 4-digit numbers to distinguish between points.</li>\n<li><em>Record elev</em>: You usually want the elevation. Set field to \"Yes\"</li>\n<li><em>Atmos crn</em>: Set to \"No\"</li>\n<li><em>C and R crn</em>: Set to \"No\"</li>\n<li><em>Sea Level crn</em>: Set to \"No\"</li>\n<li>REMEMBER: use the ENTER key (bottom left corner) after you change a field. The OK key will enter a field and often assume you are then done with that menu.</li>\n<li>After defining a job, you will be able to enter a comment. To skip this, just press OK.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Instrument</h2>\n<p>Make sure the SDR33 is connected to the total station. Under Model type, select SET 2-way, and press OK. The SDR33 will then get the serial number and current setting s from the Total Station. It will also check the measurement modes being used by the SDR33.</p>\n<h2>Job Settings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Job:\u00a0</em>Job name will be here</li>\n<li><em>Atmos crn:\u00a0</em>Set to \"Yes\".</li>\n<li><em>C and R crn:</em>\u00a0Set to \"No\".</li>\n<li><em>Sea Level crn:\u00a0</em>Set to \"No\".</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Configure Reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Type</em>: Total Stn</li>\n<li><em>Auto pt num:</em>\u00a0The number displayed here is the next automatic point number that will be used. It is usually set to 1000. I suggest using point numbers less than 1000 to indicate instrument points, and greater than 1000 to indicate surveyed points. If you are \"Plane table\" mapping with the total station, then you may want to set this number to 2, and use 1 as your first instrument point.</li>\n<li><em>Topo view stored</em>: Set to \"OBS\". This stores the observations - horizontal angle, vertical angle, and slope distance.</li>\n<li><em>Combine F1/F2:\u00a0</em>Generally set to \"No\". If it is set to yes, the SDR33 will force you to take a F1 reading, then a F2 reading. It will then average the values and inform you if the difference between reading is greater than any tolerances you have set.</li>\n<li><em># dist rdgs:\u00a0</em>Generally leave as \"1\". This is the number of distance reading the instrument will take. If greater than one, the distances are averaged. If you are only measuring angles then you can set this value to 0. This disables the EDM for normal readings.</li>\n<li><em>Trackin</em>g: Generally \"No\". If set to \"Yes\" then the EDM constantly takes measurements.</li>\n<li><em>Code list active</em>: Generally \"No\", unless you have developed a code list.</li>\n<li><em>Info blocks</em>: Set to \"0\". This is the number of comment block associated with each reading.</li>\n<li><em>Code fields:\u00a0</em>Set to \"0\".</li>\n<li><em>Recip Calc</em>: Set to \"Prompted\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tolerances</h2>\n<p>This screen lets you specify tolerances. If you have the SDR average F1/F2 readings, or when it compares a backsight reading with previous values, if the new values differ by more than the tolerances, you will be warned, and asked what you want to do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Type</em>: Generally \"Total Stn\"</li>\n<li><em>Tol H.obs</em>: Generally 30 sec</li>\n<li><em>Tol V.obs</em>: Generally 30 sec</li>\n<li><em>Edm tol (mm)</em>: Generally 5 mm</li>\n<li><em>Edm tol (ppm)</em>: Generally 3mm</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Units</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Angle:</em>\u00a0Generally use \"Degrees\"</li>\n<li><em>Dist:</em>\u00a0Generally use \"Meters\". This is the 1990's \u2026</li>\n<li><em>Pressure:</em>\u00a0Generally use \"Millibar\". This is the same as hPa. The digital barometers we have use hPa.</li>\n<li><em>Temp:</em>\u00a0Generally use \"Celsius\". Our thermometers are in \ufffdC.</li>\n<li><em>Coord:</em>\u00a0Generally use \"N-E-Elev\". This is how coordinates are given.</li>\n<li><em>Other grades:</em>\u00a0Generally use \"%\"</li>\n<li><em>Sideslope grade:</em>\u00a0Generally use \"%\"</li>\n<li><em>Sta..ing:</em>\u00a0Generally use \"10+00\"</li>\n<li><em>Decimals shown:</em>\u00a0Generally use \"3\"</li>\n<li><em>Zero azimuth:</em>\u00a0Generally use \"North\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Communications</h2>\n<p>See handout on downloading data.</p>\n<h2>Date and Time</h2>\n<p>Here you want to set the current time and date. The TimeOut is the time in minutes after which if there had been no keyboad activity the SDR33 will turn itself off. The Timestamp is the time increment between the SDR33 saving the current time in the data recorder. It is best to set 0, this turns off the Timestamp feature. If you happen to be trying to record a reading at the same time that the SDR33 is saving a timestamp you can have problems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Date</em>: Current date</li>\n<li><em>Time:</em>\u00a0Current time</li>\n<li><em>Time</em>\u00a0<em>out:\u00a0</em>Suggest 10</li>\n<li><em>Timestamp:</em>\u00a0Suggest 0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Job deletion</h2>\n<p>Use this menu item to select jobs for deletion. You cannot delete a job that has not been downloaded.</p>\n<h2>Calculator</h2>\n<p>The SDR33 has a built-in HP style calculator.</p>\n<h2>Feature code list</h2>\n<p>This allows you to have abbreviations for commonly used terms. If you have the\u00a0<em>Code List Active</em>\u00a0item in the Configure Menu set to yes then the SDR will insert the test associated with the abbreviation when making notes associated with a point. This is also used to identify different types of features you survey in. Plotting software can be configures to look at the feature and plot different symbols for that feature.</p>\n<h2>Hardware</h2>\n<p>This gives you a summary of the current hardware. Use this menu to change contrast, check batter condition, turn on the backlight, and change the volume level.

The 10% unemployment threshold was passed in our industry a while ago. Our rollercoaster can be worse than in some<br/>\nother fields.</p>\n<br/>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in;\">When times are good, the Land Surveying Business can be profitable. Others bring us work. Developers,<br/>\ncontractors, architects, engineers, and lawyers may all require or recommend<br/>\nLand Surveying Services for their Clients. <span style=\"\"><br/>\n</span> Frequently, business gets to us because another authority mandates a<br/>\nsurvey by law. In better times, we can<br/>\nhave an exciting load of attractive work with an effort as small as a few<br/>\nbusiness cards at the diner.</p>\n<br/>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Therefore, as a group, we don\u2019t recognize the value of marketing and we\u2019re skeptical to acknowledge any value for well-targeted advertising. Among many surveyors, the first budget cut in<br/>\ntough times is the only one that may bring in new business. Others would sooner deploy $40,000 to have a<br/>\ntiny edge for some unknown future client than to spend $100 to get the<br/>\njob.</p>\n<br/>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 1986, I started to understand the value of survey records.

At<br/>\nthis point, <a href=\"http://www.surveysearch.net\"><i style=\"\"><u>SurveySearch.net</u></i></a><br/>\nhas over 100,000 job sites in the database representing about 45 professionals<br/>\nthroughout Southern New England. This is just the start. The project will work everywhere.<span style=\"\"><br/></span></p>\n<br/>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Here\u2019s how it works in a nutshell:</p>\n<br/>\n<ol style=\"margin-top: 0in;\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">Professional Surveyors can join the SurveySearch network and upload a job list with an Excel template for a low annual subscription</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"\">For NO CHARGE consumers key in the address of a site where they need surveying services..

Though GIS is a complex system, the\nbenefits and uses of GIS are readily applicable to the masses. This\narticle tries to explain the basics of GIS, its nuances, benefits and\npractical uses for everyone.</h2>\n<br/><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">What is GIS?</span></h2>\nThink of maps on computer. That's a very simple way to start understanding GIS. <br/><br/>Let's break down the term Geographic Information Systems, to understand each part:<br/><br/><b>Geographic</b> = a location. For example - your house, a city, a highway connecting two cities<br/><b>Information</b> = information about the location. For example - how many people in the house, name of the city, lanes in the a highway<br/><b>System</b> = that ties-in the above two<br/><br/>GIS is a unique because<div><ul>\n<li><span>It combines location and information about the location. Using GIS, you\ncan not only see the 'place' but find out more information about the\nplace. Putting this concept in a system - typically a computer software\n- gives the ability to analyze this information in a powerful way.</span></li>\n<li><span>It gives the ability to see and analyze many 'layers' of information at\nonce. Many types of data, can be layered and analyzed together.</span></li>\n<li style=\"list-style: none; display: inline\"><ul>\n<li><i>For example, to find a suitable site for a new business in a city, one\nwould need these different layers: land parcels, roads, population,\nhousehold income, etc.</i></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><br/></div>\n<div><a name=\"Some_common_GIS_terminology\" class=\"knol-anchor-headings\"></a><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">Some common GIS terminology</span></h2>\n<div>Before we dive-in, there are a few terms which you may not be familiar with:</div>\n<div><b>Spatial</b> : relating to 'space' or 'location'</div>\n<div><b>Geospatial</b>: Relating to location on earth, commonly used term to describe many GIS data and analysis</div>\n<div><b>GPS</b>: Global Positioning System, a satellite based system that gives accurate location information anywhere on earht.</div>\n<div><br/></div>\n<a name=\"How_does_GIS_work(3F)\" class=\"knol-anchor-headings\"></a><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">How does GIS work?</span></h2>\n<br/>The GIS workflow consists of following steps:<br/><ul>\n<li><b>Data Collection</b>: To build any GIS, we need data. The data is collected, converted to a\nconvenient format and stored for use in subsequent processes.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style: none; display: inline\"><ul>\n<li><i>Example: If you are building a GIS Emergency Response, one needs data on road\nnetworks in the city, location of hospitals/fire stations/police\nstations, addresses of residents etc. Various tools such as GPS\ndevices, Aerial photos, Survey equipment etc. can be used for data\ncollection</i></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><b>Display and Analysis</b>: The stored data is displayed and analyzed as per requirement. The data is\ndisplayed on a computer screen and the operator gives commands to\nperform analysis.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style: none; display: inline\"><ul>\n<li><i>Example: To find the shortest route from a house to the nearest hospital, the operator analyzes using a\nroute finding algorithm on the roads data and the resulting path is\ndisplayed on the computer screen. Many different types of data is\ndisplayed as different layers and they are analyzed together.</i></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><b>Sharing</b>: The result of analysis needs to be shared with the decision maker for further action.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style: none; display: inline\"><ul>\n<li><i>Example: In emergency response, the shortest route found using analysis, can be\nshared with the ambulance driver in form of printed or verbal\ninstruction.</i></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br/><a name=\"GIS_Data\" class=\"knol-anchor-headings\"></a><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">GIS Data</span></h2>\n<br/>Majority time and effort in GIS is spent on collecting, formatting and storing\nthe source data. So it is important to understand the nature of the GIS\ndata and collection methods.<br/><br/>Two broad categories of GIS data are:<br/><ul>\n<li><b>Vector</b>: In a GIS, real-world objects are represented using either points, lines or polygons.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style: none; display: inline\"><ul>\n<li><i>For example, a city's government may store the location of garbage\ncollection sites as points, roads as lines and property boundaries as\npolygons.</i></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Most commonly used data format for vector data is a shapefile . Other formats<span><a href=\"http://knol.google.com/k/spatial-thoughts/gis-for-beginners/jtpfq4rvve4s/2#references\">[1]</a></span><br/></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><b>Raster</b>: Raster data can be thought of as a photograph. Commonly used raster\ndata is aerial photos, satellite images, scanned maps and digital\nelevation models. These 'pictures' can be called a GIS data source when\nthey contain information about the location - which part of the\nreal-world do they represent. Hence, the raster data formats allow for\nstoring real world coordinates of each pixel in the data. <br/></li>\n<li style=\"list-style: none; display: inline\"><ul>\n<li>Most commonly used data formt for raster data is tiff/geotiff . Ohter formats<span><a href=\"http://knol.google.com/k/spatial-thoughts/gis-for-beginners/jtpfq4rvve4s/2#references\">[2]</a></span><br/></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>All GIS data, contains two-types of information - <i>location</i> and <i>information about the location</i>. So vector data will have coordinates ( location ) and attributes ( information about the location ).</div>\n<div><ul>\n<li><span><i>Example: A point data for a garbage collection site will have</i></span></li>\n<li style=\"list-style: none; display: inline\"><ul>\n<li><i>Coordinates - latitude and longitude of earth</i></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Attributes - zip code, pickup time etc.</i></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br/><a name=\"Applications_of_GIS(5B)3(5D)\" class=\"knol-anchor-headings\"></a><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">Applications of GIS</span><span><a href=\"http://knol.google.com/k/spatial-thoughts/gis-for-beginners/jtpfq4rvve4s/2#references\">[3]</a></span></h2>\n<br/><ol>\n<li><b>Emergency Response</b>: GIS helps locate where help is needed and finding the shortest route for the responders to get there</li>\n<li><b>Utility:</b> Power, Telecom, Oil and Gas companies use GIS to map and manage their networks.</li>\n<li><b>Urban Planning</b>: Planners use GIS to monitor city growth and identify areas future development</li>\n<li><b>Insurance services</b>: Insurance companies can process claims much faster and accurately, if\nthey have access to mapping data and geographical information.

However, recently with the advent of\ninternet and freely available mapping applications has enabled a large\nnumber of people to utilize GIS. Applications such as <a href=\"http://earth.google.com/\">Google Earth</a>, <a href=\"http://maps.live.com/\">Microsoft Virtual Earth</a> etc. enables non experts to use GIS for real-estate, insruance, media, archaeology, wildlife management and much more.<br/></div>\n</div>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol id=\"knol-references\">\n<li>OGR Vector Formats<br/><a href=\"http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html\">http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html</a></li>\n<li>GDAL Raster Formats<br/><a href=\"http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html\">http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html</a></li>\n<li><span><a href=\"http://gisindia.blog/\" class=\"smarterwiki-linkify\">http://gisindia.blog</a></span>spot.com<br/><a href=\"http://gisindia.blogspot.com/search?q=101\">OMG!

We have many members who are having issues in the field simply because the equipment manufacturers do not offer the support needed for certain types of equipment-especially out dated or earlier versions. By visiting <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/page/local-1\">this page</a> and joining a group based on your geographical location and the types of equipment you use in the field, it will become easier for you down the road to quickly get support on issues by simply asking a question to the related group, which will then send a real time support ticket out to all other members of that group. This can make response time and turnaround in less than 5 minutes once the groups become populated with members who know what they are doing and other members who are learning. Each group will have its own dedicated troubleshooting discussion forum and the latest updates from manufacturers in those related groups. In addition, these groups can be accessed from any mobile phone so getting the help you need from the field should no longer be an issue.<br/><br/>For your convenience, I've added these new groups to this blog post. If you'd like to join a group, simply click on the group below which will take you to the LSU group for you to join.<br/><h2 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node G01r02tu\"><small><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Group Support</span></small></h2>\n<small><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Support Manufacturer-Based<br/></span></small><small><a href=\"../../group/leicasupportgroup\">Leica\nSupport Group</a></small><br/>\n<small><a href=\"../../group/navcomsupportgroup\">NAVCOMSupport Group</a></small><br/>\n<small><a href=\"../../group/magellansupportgroup\">MagellanSupport Group</a></small><br/>\n<small><a href=\"../../group/nikonsupportgroup\">NikonSupport Group</a></small><br/>\n<small><a href=\"../../group/trimblesupportgroup\">TrimbleSupport Group</a></small><br/>\n<small><a href=\"../../group/sokkiasupportgroup\">SokkiaSupport Group</a></small><br/>\n<small><a href=\"../../group/topconsupportgroup\">TopconSupport Group</a></small><br/>\n<br/>\n<hr style=\"width: 100%; height: 2px;\"/><span class=\"SKYUI-Higlight-Marker\" id=\"SKYUI-Higlight-Marker-66436\"></span><h3 class=\"SKYUI-Highlight-Node P01r02nb\"><small><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pro Support by Location</span></small></h3>\n<a href=\"../../group/surveyorsnorthamerica\">North<br/>\nAmerica</a><br/>\n<a href=\"../../group/surveyorssouthamerica\" rel=\"me\">South America</a><br/>\n<a href=\"../../group/surveyorsaustralia\" rel=\"me\">Australia</a><br/>\n<a href=\"../../group/surveyorsasia\" rel=\"me\">Asia</a><br/>\n<a href=\"../../group/surveyorsafrica\" rel=\"me\">Africa</a><br/>\n<a href=\"../../group/surveyorseurope\" rel=\"me\">Europe</a><br/><br/><br/>Enjoy Surveyors...let's get busy!<br/><br/><br/>","createdDate":"2010-03-14T20:44:10.243Z","updatedDate":"2018-11-18T06:26:49.078Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2010-03-14T20:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:16189","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"ad spacedraft","description":"<br/><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/ddjanUXD-BB62bbjSNmHKrFUD-aFrqpC3yNPRMp2PVjDKZ4gGWboTKEzyorcZonAmbLaIq287yAbCM3YRHHTySN3-IzVtNpZ/youradhere_LSU.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.ning.com/profile/LandSurveyorUnitedAdmin\">inquire</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/GtgS2uiYZDfpWvhk-GaaXEUK*yw63xJUyRbE1auKyoQjn1V6D-*yqHhqBhqEMRCR5mQ-kE1oZvz9VgogTPaPyQSUhK9Bu9Dk/youradhere_LSU_125X300.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.ning.com/profile/LandSurveyorUnitedAdmin\">inquire</a><br/></p>","createdDate":"2010-03-08T23:17:58.839Z","updatedDate":"2010-03-08T23:17:58.839Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"draft","publishTime":"2010-03-08T23:17:58.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:16175","contributorName":"2ihjx85n4v3dw","title":"Field Hack: Update Status from Your Phone for LSU, Twitter, Facebook and Myspace Simultaneously","description":"<h1 class=\"grey_h answer_title\">Send in photos or videos by phone or email</h1>\n<br/>When you joined <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.ning.com\">Land Surveyors United</a>, a unique Add By Phone email address is assigned to your profile on that network.

These things like virtual flowers and teddy bears are crap that no surveyor in thier right mind would send to another person, much less another surveyor. The exciting news is that I have discovered a way to upload custom gift icons to the network such as total stations, software, GPS and data collectors. These \"gifts\" make for better expressions of appreciation and conversation openers than some random Hallmarky glitter dog from the 90's. Also, I would like to extend this option to all of you who would like to add a custom gift to the network. <br/><br/><br/><span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; TEXT-DECORATION: underline\">Here's how you make a \"Custom Gift\":</span><br/><ol>\n<li>Open any image editor such as Photoshop, Aviary or GIMP</li>\n<li>Create a new document at 64px X 64px with a resolution of 72dpi</li>\n<li>Now open any picture on your harddrive such as a bushaxe or tribrach for example</li>\n<li>Resize that image so that the longest side is adjusted to 64px-now drag it over onto the blank document you just created.</li>\n<li>Clean the image up anyway you like and Save for Web as a jpg, png or gif file</li>\n<li>Name it something which represents what the image is, separating words with an underscore (_) (for example: bush_axe.png or Sokkia_stratus_gps.png)</li>\n<li>Now send this image to me at landsurveyorsunited-at-gmail and I will upload it for you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; TEXT-DECORATION: underline\">Some Example Gifts:</span><br/><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/qSYa0tjV4yD82gy0hXmHom3SkChHl54HYpcEzACNqb0CRM453hwFcMtUOx1OC0B09uFPmedMLKaMZVpd3M3fgpryMNRnsOUR/backsite_prism.png\"/><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/uUiTRCcy9rxvVZ-CtWVMgtUi9nQ7VT7gvuU-koLBq8pNG1WAirZQFnoA3yDhzDsz8Or-BYj6nQsua56gKyBpl4nI0Cyhu5tx/allegro_gift.png\"/><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/hG3drvtcscfgJltsO8HEsvq23zeh-b6j3o1Ynawi-5BY*T4n51vC8Gu45*RrOcTUMXF98Vcl4Ibz5tkoANGtDMcvuTfMRkjp/sokkia_stratus_gift.png\"/><br/>I have been building Ning networks for close to 3 years and only recently began to have the slightest interest in this whole \"gift-giving\" phenomenon. I descovered that if used in a slightly different manor than it was intended, I could leverage the power of the gift to do more than just ask someone for friendship-I could go a little bit further and actually open lines of communication. Just as an example, a few days ago we had a new member join us who is a very insightful representative from a well known equipment manufacturer. As a token of appreciation for joining our network (and hopefully inspiration to share the vast amount of experience and knowledge that this individual has with the group) I created a custom gift for them out of a photograph that I had taken of a piece of equipment from thier company.<br/><br/>Gifts are purchased with points, which every member has for free when they join. However, if you give a lot of gifts you will find yourself virtually broke, quick. You get 100 points when you first sign up and you use these to purchase gifts from the gift shop, which you then leave for other members in the network on thier profile pages. Just click \u201cSend Gift\u201d to complete the transaction. At launch, each gift costs 75 credits, or $1.50. When you run out of points, you can <a href=\"http://help.ning.com/cgi-bin/ning.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=3737\">purchase more credits</a> through the Gift Store with a PayPal account. You can use these gifts to <span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold\">represent tokens of appreciation</span> or <span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold\">make them represent real-world discounts and services related to your particular business</span>. <br/><br/><span style=\"FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: bold\">Why would I Want to Give Gifts?</span><br/>At this point, members purchasing gifts for other members is actually the <span style=\"FONT-STYLE: italic\">only</span> source of revenue for LSU-at least until I break down and make the planned site upgrades. In other words, LSU remains free for all members and always will-yet if you would like to give back a little something to the community, purchase gifts for other members and consider it your donation to the network. Ning splits the revenue 50/50 with me so it's not like I'm bankrolling on LSU- in fact, I am actually happy to announce that I have never made one solitary penny off of LSU. I created it and maintain it because land surveyors need this sort of resource, not because I plan to make money off of you. Lets face it, most of you at one time or another found Land Surveyors United because you have an equipment issue or trouble making something work. I'm not the type of person who can feel comfortable by profiting off of your troubles in the field- I merely want you all to be able to find solutions.<br/></p>\n<p><b><u><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: large;\">Here is an informative video on how to create custom gifts:</span></u></b></p>\n<embed wmode=\"opaque\" src=\"http://static.ning.com/socialnetworkmain/widgets/video/flvplayer/flvplayer.swf?v=201002041436\" flashvars=\"config=http%3A%2F%2Fcreators.ning.com%2Fvideo%2Fvideo%2FshowPlayerConfig%3Fid%3D4244211%253AVideo%253A1256%26ck%3D-&amp;video_smoothing=on&amp;autoplay=off&amp;isEmbedCode=1\" width=\"456\" height=\"318\" bgcolor=\"#DFE7EA\" scale=\"noscale\" allowscriptaccess=\"never\" allowfullscreen=\"false\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\"></embed> \n<br/><small><a href=\"Find''\">http://creators.ning.com/video/video\"\"&gt;Find more videos like this on <em>Creators</em></a></small><br/><p><br/>With all of that said, I just thought you deserved an explanation for the existance of a \"gift\" in a social network comprised of land surveyors. The default gifts are crap and I am open to uploading any custom gifts which you would like to give on the network. If you were looking for a way to donate or give back to the network and assist with expenses involved with maintaining the site, purchasing points for gifts is the way to go. Check out the gift store and you will see examples of some custom land surveying related gifts-then give them to your new friends and collaborators on LSU. I've taken it upon myself to make the gifts as cheap as possible, so that you can give more before having to purchase more. Every day is a good day for gift giving, if you're a land surveyor! Good luck and let me know if there's anything I can do to help you make gifts or learn how to give.<br/></p>","createdDate":"2010-01-30T22:10:54.068Z","updatedDate":"2019-01-11T09:21:59.422Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2010-01-30T22:00:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:15367","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"Surveying Associations and International Companies-[Part 3]Surveying Resources and Links","description":"<img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/mLPSmiFJA-E2zSGUEUHRhptCq-RKvQcS*oRZcUeKzf9rBNFavyCsB0DYxBSr-psVyyx4hAiwkWG9L9*-12Pi31DwGMObTZ*3/land_surveying_resources_surveying_associations.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right;\"/>Land surveying is of course one of the oldest professions known to man.

All downloaded small satellite images are saved on the disk. You can view downloaded satellite maps by Satellite Map Viewer. And you can combine them into a big BMP satellite map.\n<img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/bGM5d5lYbP3-KDdZlIsNxUKVQdMdWvAUp6p49Ntj*NrMje48bwVXkxM85wmYBR9PDrNKlV5NKF-oILhcmAUj5mrURizOJaHD/google_satellites.JPG\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right;\"/>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.allallsoft.com/gsmd\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.allallsoft.com/gsmd</a>\n\n\nHow to download?\n\nSee the screenshot. It is very easy to use.\n\nFirstly, enter a project name, such like \"Mytask.gmid\". All project files are saved as *.gmid. If you want to continue a old project, click button \"Open project\".\n\nThere are 4 parameters (Left Longitude, Right Longitude, Top Latitude, Bottom Latitude) to define the area scope of images that you want to download.\n\nThe zoom parameter define the image precision.\n\nAnd you can define how many threads you want to start to download at the same time.\n\nSelect a path to save the project and downloaded images, then click button \"Download\", OK, start downloading now ... !\n\nWhen downloading, the log window will display the downloading process. When finished, the log will be saved to a file.\n\nParameters explainment:\n\n1. Left Longitude: -180&lt;180,&gt;&lt;180,&gt;&lt;90,for&gt;&lt;90,for&gt;\"Satellite Images Viewer\".\n\nThen open a project from menu \"File\"-&gt;\"Open project...\" to view the map.\n\nHow to combine small images into one big image?\n\nAfter downloading, all small images are saved on your disk. Then you can combine them into one big image map.\n\nWe provide a tool : Combine.exe. You can run it from menu \"Tools\"-&gt;\"Combine images... \".\n\nThe output big image is in BMP format. You can convert it to other format by yourself using some image tools such like PhotoShop.\n\nHow to know the longitude and latitude of each image\n\nThere are two methods to know the longitude and latitude of every downloaded image.\n\n1. After downloading, the software will create a text file named as \"projectname_list.txt\" in your project path. In this file all the images' longigude and latitude information are saved.\n\nThe file looks like:\n\nImageFileName Left_Edge_Longitude Right_Edge_Longitude Top_Edge_Latitude Bottom_Edge_Latitude\n132778_171956.jpg: 2.34283447265625 2.34420776367188 48.85477632011322 48.85387272790248\n132778_171957.jpg: 2.34283447265625 2.34420776367188 48.85567989601490 48.85477632011322\n132778_171958.jpg: 2.34283447265625 2.34420776367188 48.85658345560757 48.85567989601490\n132778_171959.jpg: 2.34283447265625 2.34420776367188 48.85748699889132 48.85658345560757\n132778_171960.jpg: 2.34283447265625 2.34420776367188 48.85839052586622 48.85748699889132\n132778_171961.jpg: 2.34283447265625 2.34420776367188 48.85929403653233 48.85839052586622\n\n\n2. When you view map in Satellite Viewer, the longitude and latitude will be displayed in the statusbar.\n\nAnd in the log file, the exactly longitude and latitude of the downloaded area are saved as Left Longitude download.., etc.. see the followed example.\n\nAn example of log file:\n\nProject: C:\\Downloads\\paris18.gmid\nLog begin...\nNow time is:2007-5-4 14:38:41\n\nLeft Longitude input= 2.344152\nRight Longitude input= 2.355540\nTop Latitude input= 48.858895\nBottom Latitude input= 48.854270\n\nMinX = 132778\nMinY = 171956\nMaxX = 132787\nMaxY = 171961\n\nLeft Longitude download=2.34283447265625\nRight Longitude download=2.3565673828125\nTop Latitude download=48.8592940365323\nBottom Latitude download=48.8538727279025\n\nAll images' scope information are saved to C:\\Downloads\\paris18_list.txt\n\nTotal count of images would be downloaded: 60\n\nDownload threads count: 4\n\nZoom level: 18\n\npath: C:\\Downloads\\\n\nStart downloading...\n--------------------------------\nThread1:seq=4, file=132778-171959.jpg -&gt;ok!\nThread4:seq=3, file=132778-171958.jpg -&gt;ok!\nThread3:seq=2, file=132778-171957.jpg -&gt;ok!\nThread2:seq=1, file=132778-171956.jpg -&gt;ok!\n\n\n\nDownload Here: <a href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/?omnx9yrdxer\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>","createdDate":"2010-01-16T04:30:43.693Z","updatedDate":"2018-08-12T05:59:15.266Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2010-01-16T04:30:43.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:43448","contributorName":"3fcqbwga9unov","description":"Mapinfo is a very powerful GIS product.

This should take no more than 5-10 minutes and when you're finished, you'll have a more unique profile page, ready to represent you, your company or location for other surveyors across the world to admire.\n\n<b>First</b>, log in (if you haven't already) and click on the tab that says \"My Page\" in top navigation\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/fIszUl7tqlck*P-hkpsS1aFCBgcGy49E8OSXTGCg9Qs1ai3uUXYKuYpAFrVBYiSRG2NJUpmeqz315n7hLnJrwCBVPsIYOUOJ/manage.jpg\" alt=\"manage\" style=\"float: right;\"/></p>\n<b>Second</b>, go to the area of your profile directly below your profile photo which looks similar to the image pictured here and click on Manage <u>My Page</u>\n\n\n<b>Third</b>, click on the <u>Appearance</u> Link which should be in the middle of the page as pictured here.\n<img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/fIszUl7tqldEOf1R*QLTYf8vfflN40PoNqoKBASdX5bt9iTS015rpJEH3d2hCYrMUIjxa5R*2IFPL43SylKjd3f2IKeb0xDT/appearance.jpg\" alt=\"appearance\" style=\"float: right;\"/>\n\n\n<b>Fourth</b>, you'll see three options -Basic, All Options and Advanced. If you are unfamiliar with CSS and HTML I would avoid the Advanced tab. However, by changing the attributed on the other two tabs, you can change virtually every aspect of your profile including colors of links, background images, sidebars and icon colors. You can use images right on your computer or find some around the web. If you mess up a few times it's ok. Don't get frustrated- with a little bit of trial and error you will have your profile just the way you want it in no time.<img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/Sp9EFImY-2fEceUN0hud74iW5LcioQQNUqEYt2tVXMP2EIq*Fkur1iiXtdB2MuRDBqoqXJBbS0T3C6Krt-EsLsFillc0sXp8/unique.jpg\" alt=\"unique\"/>\n\n\n<div><b>A Couple of Tips:</b>\n*Be sure to include links to your company and/or land surveying organizations which you belong to on your profile in the Text Box section of your profile after customization.\n*Make sure you head over to the <b>Member Map</b> (under Pages in navigation) and add your name and location to it, which automatically links to your profile.\n*If you would like to have the exact best dimensions for images to use in Header and sidebars, send Justin a note to landsurveyorsunited@gmail.com....ask him any questions you might have. He designed the network so he's got this thing mastered.\n*If you REALLY mess it up, just go back to step 4 and click on the link that says \"Use Land Surveyors United's Theme\"\n\n</div>\n\nExamples of Customized Profiles on LSU <a href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.ning.com/forum/topics/examples-of-lsu-profile\">can be found here on this post in the Forum</a>.\n\n\nGood Luck Land Surveyors! Let's make the most unique social network anywhere for our industry...don't be afraid to show a little flair! You can always change it back tomorrow if you like.","createdDate":"2009-12-31T03:51:04.290Z","updatedDate":"2019-02-10T03:38:19.300Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2009-12-31T03:51:04.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:14758","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","description":"<a href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/JuoRnS-OcMv42isxq-6tM6FSmwL72zyOw0o-InPm28lmV9d9mmEgo7HzjeNUJ8IvAULOeK7nkhwBHPUOqiaW8cOMy2fCQEZz/lsu_gwave.html\">lsu_gwave.html</a><a href=\"%3Ca%20href=\">surveying_resources.html</a><a href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/LdBkiBvxXngYNSUJtCHjXztymxxtZuIYb93XVC\">http://api.ning.com/files/LdBkiBvxXngYNSUJtCHjXztymxxtZuIYb93XVC</a>*2vpdTMdf2haSGAQsow3gHwoVaiT2O16JGCRmwqiU-nNukIntZbJS8pJB6/lsu_gwave.html\"&gt;lsu_gwave.html","createdDate":"2009-12-30T00:41:50.396Z","updatedDate":"2009-12-30T00:41:50.396Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"draft","publishTime":"2009-12-30T00:41:50.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:14652","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","title":"Google Wave Invites for LSU Members","description":"Happy Holidays Surveyors!\nJust wanted to mention that there are a few <a href=\"http://wave.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google Wave</a> invitations available if any of you are in need of one. <img style=\"float:right;\" src=\"https://wave.google.com/wave/static/images/logo_preview.png\"/> I have 25 available so here's the deal: Kindly drop a comment under this post with a simple statement about your opinion of Land Surveyors United and how you think it is changing the way surveyors communicate and I'll send the invitation right out to you.\n\n<b>If you are Already On Google Wave</b>\nIf you are already on Google Wave, drop your wave id below if you like and lets all connect on the LSU Wave.

weeks in the swamp ...","description":"We've finally finished 6 weeks of cutting line in the central Florida swamps for a 100+ acre tract that had almost no open areas. I've been unemployed for 6 months when an old employer called me up and offered me a field position again ... I've been getting soft in the office as a manager for about 5-6 years and he wanted me to head a crew up and go line-cutting. I needed the money badly and jumped on the chance to get back out into the field with gusto. Man how 5 years of sitting on your butt can make you soft!\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/dpm9mXMOoGWDaTLfSa2SH24deF5ps1*FMZHWnpdV8YXDXN4DLPWoSF5NTxwMdlvtoXl7R2*w8ApYtlhR9xZp949KNw735fuw/Dice024.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\nThat is one of the only open areas, our rodman was being a smart-aleck and was smiling because we actually got a chance to see the sun. We had to topo this property on a 100' grid, and I bet if you flew overhead now, you could see our grid ... we cut every line out by machete and occasionally the chainsaw. We did however have the benefit of a Gator to haul equipment in as there was no way our truck could get close.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/dpm9mXMOoGU3R71FtrGkhx1J3m3EuQk-dYNGL6VPUgT5CfXKEAi*LdJgJG2JoMb9Af7grivunEp02Hxqhqs3ecwWwJtQwxsD/Misc1109007.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n\nWe saw all kinds of critters out there, a cougar (most people call them Florida Panthers but they are really cougars), wild boar, a bobcat, several eastern diamondbacks, many moccasins, a copperhead, a few pygmy rattlers ... the only things I got a picture of though were a couple of pygmy rattlers and an orb weaver (locals call them banana spiders), this one about the size of my hand or slightly smaller; I couldn't get the camera to focus real well on her.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/dpm9mXMOoGVr2riHqPVjGzTq1NJc0cLrh2O*iFGsbjIsR*mAwZMPPZNZUalinM5FYCOfU4k-cRUu0hEq*NYfc0OMRjy8XZC6/PigmyRattler003.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/dpm9mXMOoGX0rUonlSCrWUjuS9YPLLWv1uivldrOrS8KcaBiftdfsRUdHY3iQ3gD7gDJM3oSJU16UmvDZKGX*YIEBUz-koPQ/Misc1109013.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/dpm9mXMOoGUi3r9Sztxt7vGTFhmqpee3BzPrm9AHq6d9A6SZe9LRaubxkYWVRJxpiO42fGVUeiFK4vv2cgCmgZE9TTCAUj8p/Misc1109004.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>","createdDate":"2009-12-17T23:53:48.909Z","updatedDate":"2015-11-18T07:14:35.441Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2009-12-17T23:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"544331:Comment:134330","contributorName":"palmettoequipment","description":"<p>Great story, and nicely done.

Having that Gator was a real treat for us though, it was unexpected and very unlikely to happen again. Most of the time we have to walk and carry our equipment into the swamp and we don't come out until the end of the day. But this project was large enough and our boss went easy on us and rented this Gator for us, it was an immense boost in morale and production. Maybe you could give that to your project manager as an incentive to rent or buy one. Renting is not as cost effective as buying a used one, because buying a used one is cheaper and you will have it every day you need it and will have it for future projects, and the productivity boost is a big pay off.\n\nI don't have any books or websites specific to snakes off hand, though Cobras are in the same family as our Coral snakes, though the King Cobra is MUCH larger. They have the same poison and the same jaw and fang layout, which can be beneficial to you. The fangs are fixed unlike most poisonous snakes, meaning they have to have something to clamp their lower jaw on to actually bite you, such as a finger, a fold of skin, etc. They can't just bite you on the calf or forearm like most snakes do, just watch a snake 'charmer' and see how they hold their palms out flat to a cobra, the cobra can bite at his flat palm all day and never actually break the skin for poison injection.\n\nThe biggest downfall to King Cobras is their length, snake boots wont help since a snake can and often will bite at 2/3 of its body length. At 5.5m in length, a King Cobra can strike at almost 3.7m high ... taller than most people unfortunately. So he can bite well over the boots height.\n\nOur Diamondbacks are fairly non-aggressive and they warn you of their presence with their rattles ... usually. In my opinion, our worst snake is the Water Moccasin. They don't get real big like your King Cobras, they average about 1-2 meters in length, but are real thick and tend to hold their ground. Most snakes in Florida tend to want to leave humans alone, but the Moccasin will stand its ground to the end, forcing you to have to kill them with a machete or get bitten.\n\nOther creatures to watch out for in Florida are Alligators, Bobcats, Panthers, Wild Hogs, Brown Bears, Coral Snakes, Copperhead snakes, Pigmy Rattlesnakes, Black Widow spiders, Brown Recluse spiders, and Scorpions. Some are more dangerous than others, but we come into contact with them all the time.","createdDate":"2010-06-27T16:59:37.279Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:20542","contributorName":"3fcqbwga9unov","description":"If you have diamondbacks, we have king cobras.

I thought all the while that surveyors in the Philippines are more exposed to danger as we lack tools for the job for many reasons. One of them and the most frustrating one is the project cost vis-a-vis cost of tools required for the job. We often encounter very tough surveying tasks where our safety is always at stake due to threats of nature and insurgents.\nThese pictures proved me wrong. Though you have the required tools but your exposure to the danger of nature is very real. This task is undoubtedly more difficult than what I've done so far. This fuels me up to do even better for my next surveying tasks.

I've lived and worked in the \"Last Frontier\" for almost twenty years now and this season we got to go to places I've never even heard of much less seen.\nWe arrived at our base camp in Nome the last week of May. We could have postponed that a few weeks as there was still 3 to 4 feet of snow still standing on the ground on arrival. Norton Sound was still very much frozen over too.<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/HXTgQJZb50dVhIauZIngZbtVpJM83rd7Xoana*4cPevR6cwfbir9bc7ersKGAjwmCN9xNnRKpg5v2Iku3CnygCFw1vnGO1aH/DSCF0154.JPG\" alt=\"\"/></p>\nOh well, nothing to do except spend an entire day digging out \"Old Blue\" from her snowbound rest area. I don't think Jaime had seen snow and certainly not THIS snow since he worked in S. Dakota many years ago. After we floated the truck out on top of the snow to the road, we were pretty beat. Next day, we met with one of our regular customers, John H. of Nome Joint Utilities who needed us to survey out a 30' wide by 1300' easement for a new water line to be constructed in a few weeks. Needless to say, we spent the next few days attempting to dig out corners that I knew were there, but we just couldn't do it, at least not w/o a backhoe which is what we ended up using. Not exactly \"cost effective\" but boy howdy, we \"Got 'er done.\" Jaime's first trip to Alaska was beginning to be the adventure that I promised him, but was kicking my 54 year old butt pretty hard and it was only the start of the season!!!

Therefore, I contacted the Coast Guard about this. After I contacted them, they did another analysis and confirmed DOP spikes for all-in-view users too. Prompted by that, I did my own analyses and found that with PRN31 out of action for the delta-V and PRN01 not yet declared healthy, only five satellites above 5\u00b0 elevation angle (and almost colinear in the sky) will be visible at the stated locations and times, resulting in GDOP spikes approaching 100!\n\n\"So, in this case, the warning is for all users in the affected areas, not just receivers with only four channels.\"\n\nNavCen originally reported that GPS may be unreliable in certain parts of the world for short periods on September 11 as a result of a routine Delta-V maneuver with satellite #52 (PRN-31), reporting that GPS users may experience a temporary degradation in GPS reception in parts of the southwest and central United States from 13:02 UTC to 13:23 UTC on September 11.\n\nThe following areas in the United States may be affected:\n\nSouthern Nebraska\nKansas\nOklahoma\nSouthwestern Arkansas\nEastern Texas\nWestern Louisiana\n\n\nRelated Links :USCG Nav Center Issues High Horizontal Dilution of Precision Advisory","createdDate":"2009-09-11T17:31:20.300Z","updatedDate":"2016-12-20T04:42:48.497Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2009-09-11T17:31:20.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:12280","contributorName":"33kflohnv4ywn","title":"Job Listings","description":"Hi everyone!

Hatfield of SurvTech Solutions)","description":"<h2><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blogs/land-surveyors-in-the-bible-an\"><img class=\"align-right\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/T-KwHgUS1WHxrqS-hHGRr9mjhEUhi2EF39HC2*DW5GH-GsWAfN*gEknLDsUiTi7YlWHEhR-oDiuJafQhHlYjHw58c4EgeN0Y/surveyorsinbible.png?width=342\" alt=\"surveyors in the bible\" width=\"342\"/></a>Examples of Land Surveyors in The Bible by William D. Hatfield</h2>\n<br/>\nThe Bible has always been a reliable source for the history of the Jewish people. This historic account encompasses many esoteric and otherworldly encounters, but what is often overlooked is the overwhelming accounts of the day to day life, as well as, the professions of the common people. Seeing as how I work in the land surveying profession I decided to do some research into examples of the land surveying profession in the Bible.<br/>\nLand surveying is one of the world's oldest professions, from the ancient Sumerians and Egyptians and many other cultures utilizing land surveying and surveying principles in their monolithic and massive building projects. Such projects could not be undertaken without the skill and precision required with the use of a skilled land surveyor. We all know that maps have existed since the earliest times, but someone had to make those maps and do the field work associated with them. The Bible not only describes acts of land surveying, but also the description of landmarks, laws concerning surveying and boundary markers, surveying technology, measurement units, and even a surveying request for services! It's pretty amazing, but not really surprising. In this article I have mentioned some of the examples and will include a short commentary before the examples. This is not to be confused with simple measurements such as Noah building the Ark, which could be construed as a form of space measurement, but that would fall more under the category of engineering of which there are also many many examples. So for a completely accurate view, I have chosen only those passages which could only be considered as land surveying and directly relating to land surveying.<br/>\nSection 1: Examples of Laws Concerning Property Boundary and Boundary Markers<br/>\nLaws concerning many things were very strict in what is referred to as the Old Testament. Here are several examples of law and social conduct applied to the property boundaries and landmarks and boundary markers associated thereof. Why was it so important to not remove the boundary markers? First of all, we can see from the Law of Moses that to entrench on another's rights is wrong and against the word of God. Secondly, as evident in the passage from Job, we can see that dire consequences can arise from remove property markers. Aside from perturbing and defrauding neighbors of their property, the maps and local areas would not match up in the legal descriptions set forth in records. In Job we can see that by removing the landmarks it caused flocks to be stolen from their rightful owners. This can lead to property disputes and in the Job passage even livestock that lives on the property could be in dispute. This sort of unethical moving of boundaries will then lead to other problems both legally and morally.<br/>\nProverbs 22:28<br/>\nRemove not the ancient landmark, Which thy fathers have set.<br/>\nDeuteronomy 19:14<br/>\nThou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.<br/>\nDeuteronomy 27:17<br/>\nCursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.<br/>\nJob 24:2<br/>\nSome remove the landmarks; They seize and devour flocks.<br/>\nSection 2: Descriptions of Surveying Equipment and Technology<br/>\nWhile the Zechariah passages are often attributed to allegory regarding the building of God's church, we can also see that the metaphor is based on actual profession and the technology associated with it. In the next passage we see that he is measuring for the building of temple. Using the standard of a measurement for a \"reed\" we can surmise that no such temple had been built according to such a massive scale, and while this again passes into allegorical or metaphor for God's church, we again see the use of socially accepted measuring devices. In this case the reed and the measuring line. This shows a high degree of skill and precision for the ancient surveyor to consistently utilize the same standard equipment over a substantial period of time.<br/>\nZechariah 2:1-2<br/>\nI lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, to measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.<br/>\nEzekiel 42:16-19<br/>\nHe measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.<br/>\nHe measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.<br/>\nSection 3: Examples of Surveying Measurement Units<br/>\n1 long reed (Biblical) = 10.5 foot. As in Section 2, we see that the measuring unit of a \"reed\" is used again and again. Not only in surveying and engineering, but also in many construction and building projects. This shows that the professions associated with surveying, architecture, engineering, and construction used the same measurement standards between all industries. Since these industries were and still are integral parts of one another, we can then tell that this is nothing new and is just a continuation of technology, standards, measurements, and principles set forth by the ancients.<br/>\nEzekiel 42:16-19<br/>\nHe measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.<br/>\nHe measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.<br/>\nSection 4: Descriptions of Surveying Boundaries and Landmarks<br/>\nThere are many instances in the book of Numbers of a border description for the Jewish people. These stretch from the universally accepted coastline of the Mediterranean, known as The Great Sea is this passage (which coastlines along bodies of water are still universal in property and legal descriptions) to the borders of known maps of locations and nations. This is huge news in learning how ancient Israel and it's surveyors connected and cross referenced their maps and surveys with other known surveys and maps. What's more is that the description of known landmarks, both man made and natural, is a great modern day resource in retracing and recreating the ancient world.<br/>\nAgain we see the same type of mapping and boundary denotations outlined in the book of Ezekiel. The use of known legal terms (e.g. Great Sea) of known boundary markers and also the use of city names and references to known maps and surveys is given to add to the credibility and accuracy of new maps and boundaries.<br/>\nNumbers 34:6-7<br/>\nAs for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border; this shall be your west border. And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor:<br/>\nNumbers 34:12<br/>\nAnd the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.<br/>\nEzekiel 47:15<br/>\nAnd this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;<br/>\nSection 5: A Royal Request for Surveying Services<br/>\nThe Jewish Historian Josephus relates that the surveying services provided by the Jews were of the highest quality with men who were experts in geometry. Even though many biblical instances are given in generalizations, we can be sure the borders were highly accurate and were mapped as such. Joshua was a military leader and King, the notations of the lands he conquered and how that land was divided was not only of importance to tribal and familial boundary denotations, it was of the utmost importance to the continued military conquest and defense of the promised lands. Note that Joshua not only ask for them to map and denote boundaries, but he also request for physical descriptions of the landmarks. Joshua also requested the surveyed land to be described and written down. In what would be the ancient Judaic version of a Legal Property Description. After everything was written down and described, the land was also divided. This Biblical version of an ancient subdivision is of great importance as it shows that a whole area was surveyed, legally described, entered into records and then subdivided and the property ownership was transferred accordingly.<br/>\nJoshua 18:8<br/>\nThen the men arose and went, and Joshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, \"Go and walk through the land and describe it, and return to me; then I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.\"<br/>\nJoshua 18:9<br/>\nThe men surveyed the land. They described it in a book. The land was divided into seven parts according to its cities. Then they returned to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh.<br/>\nIn Closing<br/>\nWe can ascertain from a study of Hebrew history and also Egyptian history that more than likely the ancient Hebrews learned surveying technology and principles from the Egyptians. Furthermore we can see that the basic surveying principles really have not changed that much since ancient times. Of course the technology and accuracy has increased exponentially, but the basic tenets of surveying: boundary law, demarcation, subdivision, legal descriptions, accurate measuring according to social standards of measurements, and universally accepted methods; have only changed according to the cultural standards of measurement and the social legal system.<br/>\nThe Bible continues to be a fascinating exploration of both human spirituality and human technological achievement. We can glean the divine influence in the efforts of these brave men and women of ancient Judea. Furthermore, we learn that land surveying and mapping played an essential role in the establishment of the Promised Land and the defense there of, as well as, the individual's right to own, buy, and sell property according to an agreeable and legally binding standard.<br/>\nIn researching this article I have been very pleased to learn that surveying was so important to the ancient Jewish people. I also have been enlightened and I hope that this article will also enlighten you as to the expertise and technological advancement of the ancient Hebrews. In modern times, we have a tendency to think that those who came before us were so inept and backwards, I hope this article has served to show that not only did the chosen people have an immense amount of knowledge, they also applied that knowledge in ways that we are still using to this very day.<br/>\nWritten by William D.

One of the neatest things about pursuing a career in land surveying is that there are many great lifelong careers that someone can have in the industry with only a high school diploma, technical degree, or a college degree.\nHere at SurvTech most of our employees are college graduates, with a variety of degrees. The surveying industry allows for many specialized individuals to work within the field. Everyone from environmental to computer specialist can find a rewarding professional environment in land surveying.\nSo why am I so on fire about surveying? Am I not \"the marketing guy\"? LOL, while that is true, I wasn't always the marketing guy, I started just like everyone else started, out in the field, as a rodman, lowest guy on the totem pole. I think it's needed for everyone to have the proper perspective of what they're doing and where they work.\nOne of the many things that makes SurvTech so great is that everyone has field experience, this increases efficiency and communication between the field staff and office staff. I can't tell you how much easier it was to draft a project when I knew exactly what I was looking at because I too had been in the field for similar projects.\nSo I wanted to create a site to help people who were interested in land surveying. The site has links to the very best surveying schools in the United States, as well as, many great facts and benefits about the surveying profession. Included in the site are links to major professional organizations, who in their own right, have a multitude of valuable and useful links.\nIn addition, I've also included my Land Surveying for Kids Coloring Book and also made a cool narrated video of that book. While these are meant for grade school children, they are also great starting points for anyone wanting to learn more about land and hydrographic surveying.\n<object height=\"285\" width=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/m6SGhPj4Rh0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6&amp;border=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"never\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/m6SGhPj4Rh0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6&amp;border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"never\" width=\"340\" height=\"285\"></embed></object> \nI hope this information can be assistance to people, even if you aren't interested in a career, it's always fun to learn about the workings of related industries.\nAs always, if I can ever answer any questions about land surveying or help you with projects you have, feel free to contact me at anytime.\nBest Regards,\nW.

Having started in the surveying profession as a rodman myself, and working all the way up to chief, then learning how to draft and eventually coming into my current position, I think I have a unique perspective that most marketing people don't.\nOne thing we will be doing in the future at SurvTech Solutions is participating in The Great American Teach In.\nSo we wanted to create something really cool for this, that would both be educational and about surveying, but still appealing to children.\nSo I created the SurvTech Solutions Land Surveying Coloring Book! It's a children's coloring book made for kids from Kindergarten to 3rd grade. It has different types of surveying, information about different services, famous surveyors and other cool stuff. The surveyors themselves are different animal people performing the tasks. Even though it's a SurvTech copywritten material. I wanted to share it with the community as most of us have children that might think it's a neat thing to have.\nEveryone who has seen it has really enjoyed it so far, and the best thing I've heard it that it's a great way to explain what we do to our kids because some of the concepts are hard for really little kids to understand.\nIt's designed to be printed on 11 X 17 paper, single sided, but you can print it out at whatever size you want.\nIf you have any questions about how you can use it, feel free to message me here on LSU and I'd be glad to reply.\nSo enjoy! It's fun and hopefully a great introduction into the world of surveying that we call home!\nW.D.

There is so much uncertainty with their jobs, and the economy as a whole, who could blame them? In today\u2019s tough economic times it is imperative to know, and understand why, your customers are, or are not, buying your services.</p>\n\n<h3>3 Strategies for Getting Frugal Consumers' to Buy</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make it easy for your customers to find you and your services. With slow times, it\u2019s a great time to update all of your marketing materials, especially your website and telephone systems.</li>\n<li>Once your customers have found you, make sure they can find the things they are looking for. Once on your website, is it easy for them to find the information they are looking for? If not, make it happen.</li>\n<li>Consumers have shaken confidence in the value of everything they are buying. Prices, both high and low, now more than ever seem disconnected from the services and goods. Gasoline is up $2 a gallon one month, down $2 a gallon the next? Items consumers bought today are priced 75%-85% less than six months ago? So, your customers are asking what really is the value of your services? If you\u2019ve cut your prices so low in this recession, like the retailers who have marked down their merchandise by 85%, for example, how are you to convince your customers that you\u2019re actually worth more? If you kept your prices fairly steady, but your competitors cut everyone\u2019s throats, including their own, how do you convince your customers to retain you over the low-baller? With <b>VALUE!</b> It\u2019s high time to get back to business basics and sell the value of your professional land surveyor services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Eric D.

As renovations on an existing road was laid out by my partner and I. A crowded work site as everything in NYC is. However we managed to get in do the work as the ground under our feet shook as the excavation began. We took our Trimble S6 Robot and set it up to begin our layout. My Partner (Veteran Surveyor/Marine Sergeant)took his 16 plus years of experience and laid out the equipment. Only to realize that the area was to risky for the equipment. Vibration and traffic from the construction site would put the Robot at risk so he closed it down and used a level and rod to layout the small traffic circle. A great education for me his rookie partner. After boxing the Trimble S6 Total Station we quickly laid out the grade and layout for the crew to perfom the needed road work. We then proceeded to gather the equipment together to load up the truck. Taking in the beauty of the park in the middle of this city eased the pain of noise and ciaos. Like always my partner loaded the handy Trimble Total Station back pack on his back and cradled the TCU mounted on his Trimble pole with red and white support legs like it was his baby. We began our trek across the construction site. It was like a war zone heavy equipment moving everywhere. You could hardly hear a thing.\n\nMy partner explained; always make sure that the operator makes visual connection with you before you cross his path. As we walked toward the truck both loaded down with our equipment. Some wide boards had been laid across the curb to cover the demolition area. My partner took a step onto a board as we had all day long. Yet this time the board had nothing under it. Springing like a trampalin it caught his foot projecting him forward onto the ground in to a freshly crushed concrete slab with sharp freshly cut rebar sticking out like rusty bent fingers. He fell about 2 feet straight down the Robot back pack rolled him away from the 9 inch rebar that would have pierced his body. His construction helmet jumped of his head like a rock as it took the impact. Flying some 4 feet away. I must say his athleticism coupled with the robot saved his life that day. His baby the S6 Total Station, never got a scratch on it. My partner tore his knee up real bad. I offered a hand up and we limped back to the truck where he managed his wounds. As he explained this is why you always watch for the unexpected. I thought to myself thank God the robot was on his back.\n\nThe park we worked in that day includes Olympic-size pool (which is home to the Redtails swim team), a covered skating rink for roller skating in the summer and ice-skating in the winter, an 800-seat cultural theater, a 2,500-seat athletic complex with fitness room, and a 150-seat restaurant. A popular work is the Totally Kid Carousel created by Maria Reidelbach and Milo Mottola. Its beautiful! Lat. 40\u00b049'35.45\"N - Long. 73\u00b057'20.13\"W\n\nThe park is 69 feet above the Hudson. It is located on the West Side Highway from 137th Street to 145th Street in Upper Manhattan. The only state park within Manhattan, Here is the catch. It is built over the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant, which processes 125 million gallons of wastewater every day during dry weather, and it is designed to handle up to 340 million gallons a day when the weather is wet. The plant claims that its state of the art facility emits no odors, though frequent visitors to the park would disagree. The plant sits on 2,300 caissons pinned into bedrock up to 230 feet beneath the river. The plant was completed in two phases between between 1986 and 1991.","createdDate":"2009-01-30T16:08:03.783Z","updatedDate":"2018-11-21T03:02:16.984Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2009-01-30T16:08:03.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:6443","contributorName":"0br0acsom19y9","title":"Change is a comin...","description":"Well today is George Bush's last day as president.

My partner and I surveying a hillside for a construction crew. Taken by a movement across the big blue sky. A brisk south easterly wind filled the sprawling wing span of a bald eagle moving it directly into our sight path. The eagle climbing higher and higher turned its circles of flight into a hypnotic trance. For a moment we just starred at this pristine natural beauty. Emmm I can still see the white tail against the dark feathers on the body steering the eagle to gain control of the winds. The white face scanning the ground. Out stretched 7 foot wings would take the eagle out of sight. My imagination followed the massive bird beyond the limits of my eye sight as I continued to work. Its moments like this, I realized, that remind me of the majesty around us everyday. This gift, this intersection of my path with this eagles path was not just coincidence. More of a confirmation. That I am on the right path in my journey. Possibly while surveying we where being surveyed that day. It seems the great outdoors always holds these moments for us. Free of charge just waiting for us to realize we can\u2019t buy it, we can\u2019t control it, we just need to get out into the outdoors more often. Here in the outdoors is where I belong, the more I am here the stronger I become. One day like the eagle I will stretch out my wings and fly until that day. I will visit often that day watching the eagle and the sight of its flight. Just think this was all created for us. For this I am thankful and will be all the days of my life.","createdDate":"2009-01-18T12:03:42.046Z","updatedDate":"2018-09-19T16:43:16.430Z","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2009-01-18T12:03:42.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"544331:BlogPost:6264","contributorName":"usevwajsy7ha","title":"AutoCAD Civil 3D 2009 Update 2 is available for download","description":"<p>Autodesk has released its AutoCAD Civil 3D 2009 Update 2.

What caught my attention is when he mentioned that 2 months ago he was \u201cflat out\u201d and now has very little work. This didn\u2019t surprise me and I now know, from experience, that this is just the beginning for him, and things may get worse.</p>\n<p>If you look at the timeline listed below, you will see that Rhode Island has been in a recession from August 2007 (economist agree to this, it\u2019s not just my data). Land surveyors and engineers in this area went from being full out with work to having no new work coming in at all. The phones have just completely stopped ringing. I know that I was prepared, or at least preparing, for a slowdown \u2013 But I wasn\u2019t prepared enough for a complete work stoppage.</p>\n<p><b>I\u2019m not talking about it being slow \u2013 I\u2019m talking about it being DEAD!</b></p>\n<p>I've talked to other surveyors and engineers who are experiencing the same thing and several have told me that they\u2019ve picked up their phones to make sure their phones are working (me too)- it's that bad. If your area hasn't reached this low point yet, let me warn you that the future is this: People are absolutely unwilling to spend ANY money and very little new work will be available.</p>\n<p>And, what little work that materializes will be snatched up by fear ridden low-ballers chasing cash in a desperate attempt to \u201ckeep the wheels from coming off of the wagon\u201d. The willingness of some to take any job, at any cost, regardless of what it will take to get the job done, has been very discouraging and is a failed strategy form the start by these despicable cutthroats. The good news is that eventually they will be out of business: The only viable business strategy is to be profitable \u2013 even if it\u2019s only a little.</p>\n<p><b>Economic Timeline:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Things started downward in August 2007, but our backlog held out for quite awhile.</li>\n<li>Then in January 2008 business stopped dead. No new work came in and the phones stopped ringing completely.</li>\n<li>We experienced a small bump in April 2008. Then it went back to nothing, again.</li>\n<li>By June/July 2008 it looks like we hit rock bottom (at least I hope) with virtually no work coming in and no phone calls.</li>\n<li>Beginning in late August, the phones started to ring again with inquiries into having surveying work done. Not everyone is going ahead with their plans, but at least they\u2019re thinking about spending their money again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a long time now, whenever I would tell people that the economy was getting bad, I would get a response that I can only describe as, living in a fantasy world. One week I would meet with an engineer, for example, who would tell me that everything was fine. I\u2019d say, somewhat quizzically, \u201creally, because I\u2019m finding it just awful\u201d. He or she would say that, \u201cyeah the phones are slow but we\u2019re doing a lot of work\u201d. Then in the very next sentence, he or she would confide that they are owed tens of thousands of dollars for over 90 or 120 days! As the financial/lending house of cards tumbled down, people completely stopped paying their bills. This was very common with developers who owed on work already completed and billed.</p>\n<p>A week or two later this company typically laid off nearly everyone. I\u2019ve witnessed this several times and have also had entire field crews call or stop by my office looking for work, where their bosses told me weeks before that everything was rosy.</p>\n<p><b>To prepare you I offer the following advice:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your business is not near the bottom yet, or coming out of the recession, please prepare yourself for the worst. Cut all costs; reduce the number of offices, employees, vehicles, etc. If it can be eliminated or sold for cash, do it now!</li>\n<li>Be prepared to keep your business running with absolutely no work or payments coming in - for many months. You will not be seeing much in the way of deposits, if anything and you will only receive payments in dribs and drabs.</li>\n<li>Collect everything you can from people that owe you money and don't release any work unless you\u2019re paid first. This is a practice that has to be changed now and forever. We, as land surveyors, are not banks and should not engage in the business of lending money. In case you haven\u2019t noticed lately, even banks are not very good at evaluating risk and successfully lending out money. If a client isn\u2019t paying you it\u2019s because you\u2019ve allowed him or her to use you as a cheap way to borrow money, often at no added cost above the amount borrowed \u2013 What a good deal for him or her!</li>\n<li>Do invest in the following; yourself, technology and marketing. Now is the time to stop carrying everyone else on your shoulders and invest in yourself. Work to payback you! Invest in technologies, like Robotics and GPS, which enable you, as a business owner, to reduce your staff, and get the job done better, faster and cheaper. Finally, do invest in marketing as this is the only way to successfully navigate your ship through these turbulent waters and grow (save) your business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am only being somewhat alarmist because I\u2019ve been dealing with this severe recession and I want you to be ready for it. I will say, however, that the people in my area, now in 16 months of recession, may be loosening up on their purse strings and hopefully will spend a little money on surveying their land. I think we're ahead of the curve here and I want you to be prepared. It is, however, still a very difficult business environment.</p>\n<p><b>Good luck and work hard!</b></p>\n<p><em>Eric D.

While cost cutting is so very important, you shouldn't cut back too much on your marketing efforts, if you can afford it. Some of the following strategies to get more work, however, cost very little and can be implemented quickly.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Call Your Existing Clients:</strong> Call your existing clients to see how they're doing and ask if they're considering any new work to let you give them a price. You should always keep in regular contact with your clients, but if you haven't before, now is the time to get in the habit of doing this. Remember, just because a client hired you before, even if you did a great job and you and the client got along well, there are a lot of professional land surveyors hungry for work and eager to steal your clients: your client may also be interested in shopping around, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Answer your phones:</strong> I'm constantly amazed at how few professional land surveyors either do not answer their phones, or are not prompt in returning calls. If you don't answer your phones, or return calls promptly, you'll never get the client to begin with. Again, prospective clients have a large pool of professional land surveyors to choose from, at every price point (maybe lower than yours), so if you're not in the competition from the get-go (regardless of what your fee may be), you'll be completely out of the running to get this new work.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact past clients that may need new work done:</strong> Hopefully you have been diligently creating a complete contact list for all of the people that you deal with in running your professional land surveying company. Names, mailing addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers, to name but a few, are vital business data that you need to collect and keep updated about everyone. Now use it!</li>\n<li><strong>Do guerrilla marketing for a geographic area:</strong> Pick an area that you're familiar with, or would like to expand into, and do bulk mailings in that area. Let them know who you are, how to contact you, and how your professional land surveying services can benefit them. I bet you can think of an area, say a large subdivision for example, that you practically surveyed the entire subdivision just to survey one small lot within it. This work, extending beyond the limits of the original surveyed parcel, is an area that you can look for a return on your investment.</li>\n<li><strong>Box in the low-ballers:</strong> I've noticed lately, not unlike what has been happening within the financial markets, fear is gripping some of the professional land surveyors in my area. I've seen ridiculously low fees quoted for work that they can't possibly make any money on. In my opinion, to be able to do this work, at low-ball fees, they very well may cut corners in their work. Therefore, whenever you give a quotation, send a mailing to the neighbors and other property owners in the neighborhood. Neighbors may hire you if for no other reason than for a second opinion. If the first professional land surveyor did a good job, then your work should be easier to carry out. If corners were cut, then their client will soon realize that they got exactly what they paid for: very little.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This is just a short list. The point is to not sit back and let the recession happen to you. Take charge and apply yourself, as it's now more than ever a time to become more disciplined in how you manage and run your professional land surveying business. Got any other ideas?
