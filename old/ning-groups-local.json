There are many who have never used a HP and the 41 is in alphanumeric RPN. This is no HP35s, the programming is the most advanced RPN that has every been written for a calculator.</p>\n<p>\u00a0You can still buy this calculator, they are not cheap. I for one do not think RPN is dead,Hp is still making the HP 35s as far as a scientific calculators goes and how do you get any better than it for the NCEES test. SwissMicros inc. makes \u00a0Hp calculators clones in RPN and they are very good product. They may not like to call them that because this is not a HP calculator. But the DM41L is a clone of the 41 CX \u00a0And the DM41, this is the smaller version. The HP Prime can be programed in macro RPN, So lets keep the HP 41's where it belongs.In our hands.</p>\n<p>I wish HP still made one or a newer version,</p>\n<p>something like it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.swissmicros.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.swissmicros.com/index.php</a></p>","createdDate":"2017-08-27T14:43:50.866Z"}]},{"id":"544331:Group:375610","contributorName":"0ns85ticb2muk","title":"Republic of Georgia Support Group","description":"<p>Georgian Land surveyors support group\u00a0</p>","createdDate":"2017-04-18T19:41:11.928Z","updatedDate":"2017-04-18T20:08:41.913Z","approved":"Y","allowInvitations":"Y","allowMemberMessaging":"Y","groupPrivacy":"public","iconUrl":"groups/16-Flag_map_of_the_Republic_of_Georgia.png","memberCount":"1","url":"republic-of-georgia-support-group","members":[{"contributorName":"0ns85ticb2muk","fullName":"aleksandre gurgenidze","status":"admin"}]},{"id":"544331:Group:369261","contributorName":"24jrvy9be2b2b","title":"Basavaraju s","createdDate":"2017-03-04T16:55:21.800Z","updatedDate":"2017-03-04T21:57:55.885Z","approved":"Y","allowInvitations":"Y","allowMemberMessaging":"Y","groupPrivacy":"public","iconUrl":"groups/17-011.jpg","memberCount":"1","url":"basavaraju-s","members":[{"contributorName":"24jrvy9be2b2b","fullName":"Basavaraju S Surveyor","status":"admin"}]},{"id":"544331:Group:368974","contributorName":"0temj689ug9p4","title":"Surveying Bloopers","description":"<p>Surveying can be a high stress, long hours and long days on site...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But we've all been around long enough to come accross something hilarious, something ridiculous and something damn right funny or facepalm worthy.

The longer I am in surveying, a total of 20 years now, the more need I see for staying connected and helping as much as I can the surveying community I belong to. Last year, I decided a good way that I could help surveyors and surveying companies, was to make finding good surveyors and good surveying jobs easier. So from that thought, Surveyor Placement Services was born. Surveyors helping surveyors; that is what I want to do. I am thankful to LSU for allowing me to have a forum to help reach this community. The more we can grow the SPS network, the more companies will contact SPS to see what surveyors are in the area they need to find employees. Once I receive an inquiry, I will pass it on to the surveyors in that area.

My old software I go to the job pick a point between 2 I think are ok. Locate everything else.

Resulting Problems","description":"<p>A job a few years ago had me working as a consultant in retracing a 1891&nbsp;GLO resurvey of a few sections of an 1873 original Survey by W.H. Norway in the coastal mountains of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In 1978, before I was really working in the business, just getting to understand the issues of retracing GLO lines, I met a prolific South Coast Surveyor named Jed Berkeley Blake, P.L.S. 4786.&nbsp; He had gone toe to toe with the BLM in court on several occasions and pointed out what he called \"prima facie fraud\" in some 1891 field notes by a surveyor named J.K. Harrington.&nbsp; This was in the Santa Ynez valley where a township crosses the coastal summit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Harrington describes a 1/4 corner as a \"post in a mind of rock\" as established by Norway as a deputy surveyor\", but Norway before him set a \"sand rock, 18\" x 12\" x 10\",&nbsp; Blake said, \"I'd go to court on that one\".</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now, 33 years later I'm acting as a consultant and crew for another accomplished P.L.S., Bruce D. Barton, #5555, and its in the same township but on the coastal side.&nbsp; The notes of Harrington have a similar problem.&nbsp; Harringtons description is different.&nbsp; He states this \"From the witness cor. To secs. 21, 22, 27 and 28 which is a sandstone 8x10x12 ft. marked W.C . I run N, on land bet, Sec. 27 and 28.&nbsp; Ascending a brushy ridge.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Norway gives no dimensions and describes a \"W.P.\" and the topography north gets this description.&nbsp; \"The Mountains to the north are too rough and worthless to measure further.\"&nbsp; Norway was intrepid and rarely stopped by topography, and if he was, it was because it was simply ridiculous to try and even travel over it let alone measure by any means.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In discussion with another surveyor. M.L. Grant (R.C.E.7704) regarding Norway's work; Grants father&nbsp; (P.L.S.1239) had worked under Frank Flournoy (P.L.S.189) who had worked under Norway and was familiar with many of his methods.&nbsp; Particularly note keeping.&nbsp; Grant explained that his father had seen that Norway kept two sets of notes.&nbsp; One for monuments set and another for topography.&nbsp; His topographic notes were extensive and this made it so he did not have to search pages of notes to find monument descriptions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Grant and his father noticed on a few lines retraced that occasionally a section line suffered switching of descriptions with another nearby line.&nbsp; This caused huge problems for preceding surveyors as well as them and they speculated that the telegraphed notes exacerbated this so badly that Harrington, who they were familiar with, simply set a corner and made up a description of the monument he supposedly found and continued with his survey.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In our situation we were able to unravel the switched original notes by Norway and see that Harringtons beginning point which was not tied to any preceding monument was bogus and we proceeded to find Norway's oriental monuments, BUT, there were efforts to obliterate them.&nbsp; Fortunately one was a pit carved into solid sandstone that was filed with fluffy red dirt fro the decaying redwood post he set.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The question is, \"How much weight should the presence of prima facie evidence of fraudulent notes have in the use of the same surveyors descriptions, locations of section lines in the same township of the same year?\"&nbsp; Would you as a surveyor be inclined to reject the notes for a specific monument altogether when there were significant inconsistencies in the monument description and adjacent topography?&nbsp; Or would you use them as if there was no issue?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The web pages linked are comprised of the land owners complaint to the California Licensing Board regarding retracing conducted over such lines with these problems. &nbsp;The owners are badly impacted and surveyors logically using the notes, after unraveling the issues, have found original monuments.&nbsp;</p>","createdDate":"2015-06-13T17:14:16.726Z","updatedDate":"2015-06-14T16:42:48.054Z","approved":"Y","allowInvitations":"Y","allowMemberMessaging":"Y","groupPrivacy":"public","memberCount":"1","url":"issues-of-glo-notes-transcribed-telegraphed-1880-s","members":[{"contributorName":"14s7ivok82tfo","fullName":"Christopher A.

The dead job files have had any survey plans removed from them so they are basically files with correspondence only.</p>","createdDate":"2014-04-25T02:19:35.702Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:259833","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"<p>Great group idea Maurice.. just to let you know we will be migrating our entire network to a new and improved platform, which will add a lot of functionality to this group. \u00a0There are even talks of an integrated cloud archiving system. \u00a0But for now here are a couple of tips regarding the advise you seek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No one is going to be able to see the comment you left below unless they join the group. \u00a0No one will join the group until there are discussions rolling through it, so your best bet is to +Start a new Discussion above and ask specifically for what you are looking for in detail. \u00a0Also, since you are the moderator of this group, you should click the Add Text button above and add more details about what you hope to accomplish within this group so that members will get interested in joining the group and contributing. \u00a0Welcome and looking forward to helping you transform this group into a productivity booster for you and other surveyors interested in the best practices for archiving survey files.</p>","createdDate":"2014-04-24T23:07:44.230Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:259732","contributorName":"1wv1yaig84l44","description":"<p>The picture for this group is taken at Goose Lake, Nunavut, Canada.</p>\n<p>I hope someone has some comments on archiving survey files.</p>\n<p></p>","createdDate":"2014-04-23T19:44:07.258Z"}]},{"id":"544331:Group:249114","contributorName":"04z9kiu0giq2n","title":"I Love Geodesy","createdDate":"2013-12-02T23:22:21.792Z","updatedDate":"2014-04-04T17:23:07.927Z","approved":"Y","allowInvitations":"Y","allowMemberMessaging":"Y","groupPrivacy":"public","memberCount":"3","url":"ilovegeodesy","members":[{"contributorName":"04z9kiu0giq2n","fullName":"Jan \u0160pi\u010dka","status":"admin"},{"contributorName":"0hxaab2b92sry","fullName":"Deddy Priatna","status":"member"},{"contributorName":"palmettoequipment","fullName":"ePalmetto","status":"member"}]},{"id":"544331:Group:248091","contributorName":"124d8fkpro1hj","title":"Thailand Surveyors","description":"<p sizset=\"false\" sizcache09772593594701107=\"726.718281828459 48 51\">Thai Surveyors group is a support forum for Thai surveyors to discuss and share surveying experience, knowledgement and all things related to land surveying in Thailand. <br />[Supported LSU and Thai Surveyors group by Geospatial JS on <a href=\"http://www.geomatics-tech.blogspot.com/\">www.geomatics-tech.blogspot.com</a>]</p>","createdDate":"2013-11-13T10:23:59.791Z","updatedDate":"2018-11-30T01:56:55.564Z","approved":"Y","allowInvitations":"Y","allowMemberMessaging":"Y","groupPrivacy":"public","iconUrl":"groups/50-th.jpg","memberCount":"5","url":"thailand-surveyors","members":[{"contributorName":"124d8fkpro1hj","fullName":"Geospatial JS","status":"admin"},{"contributorName":"26b0j33idcnt5","fullName":"Rahadian Fauzi","status":"member"},{"contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","fullName":"\u26a1Survenator\u2301","status":"member"},{"contributorName":"07ggo68fn28xj","fullName":"Ernest Khoo Hock Oon","status":"member"},{"contributorName":"3047etbf2iwdy","fullName":"Ekkasit Buaban","status":"member"}]},{"id":"544331:Group:239805","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"Beta Testers New LSU","description":"<p>Our Community has outgrown this platform.

Prof. Carlito Vieira de Moraes, Engenheiro Agrimensor. No Brasil se discutiu a redu\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00famero de cursos de engenharia, mediante o projeto do Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o \u201cReferenciais Nacionais dos Cursos de Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o: Bacharelados e Licenciaturas\u201d, publicado para consulta p\u00fablica em junho de 2009. Reduziram-se algumas especialidades existentes. Uma delas foi a unifica\u00e7\u00e3o da Engenharia de Agrimensura com a Engenharia Cartogr\u00e1fica. Conforme a institui\u00e7\u00e3o de ensino, o novo curso passou a chamar \u201cCurso de Engenharia de Agrimensura e Cartogr\u00e1fica\u201d ou \u201cCurso de Engenharia Cartogr\u00e1fica e de Agrimensura\u201d. As institui\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o, por exemplos, a UFV, a UFBA, a UFPR, a UFU, a UFRRJ, o IF de Inconfidentes-MG e a UNISINOS. O Brasil \u00e9 um dos pa\u00edses mais pobres em cartas topogr\u00e1ficas de seu territ\u00f3rio, as quais s\u00e3o fundamentais para o planejamento e a execu\u00e7\u00e3o das obras de infraestrutura. As cartas que existem na escala 1:25.000 carecem de atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o. As cartas na escala 1:10.000 que s\u00e3o apropriadas ao planejamento e \u00e0 execu\u00e7\u00e3o das obras de infraestrutura cobrem uma pequena parte do territ\u00f3rio brasileiro e est\u00e3o desatualizadas. O planejamento e a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de cartas topogr\u00e1ficas do territ\u00f3rio s\u00e3o especificidades, entre outras, do Engenheiro Cart\u00f3grafo. A nova profiss\u00e3o resultante da unifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos cursos provocar\u00e1 insufici\u00eancia de conhecimento, em virtude da redu\u00e7\u00e3o da carga hor\u00e1ria e prejudica as especificidades na profiss\u00e3o. As 3600 horas-aula (carga m\u00ednima), previstas pela Resolu\u00e7\u00e3o CNE/CES 2/2007, para os cursos de gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em engenharia s\u00e3o insuficientes em um curso unificado. Os defensores da unifica\u00e7\u00e3o se ap\u00f3iam na premissa de que os conte\u00fados destes cursos diferem entre si muito pouco. Isto se deve \u00e0 concep\u00e7\u00e3o da forma\u00e7\u00e3o apenas generalista que \u00e9 uma das partes da forma\u00e7\u00e3o do engenheiro. Mas a engenharia \u00e9 uma ci\u00eancia aplicada e, por isso, \u00e9 especificista. As forma\u00e7\u00f5es de Engenheiro Agrimensor e de Engenheiro Cart\u00f3grafo s\u00e3o distintas, conforme demonstram suas respectivas organiza\u00e7\u00f5es existentes nos pa\u00edses desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento. As organiza\u00e7\u00f5es provam que a Agrimensura e a Cartografia s\u00e3o verdadeiros patrim\u00f4nios da humanidade e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 raz\u00e3o para a unifica\u00e7\u00e3o. As suas respectivas engenharias s\u00e3o patrim\u00f4nios brasileiros que precisam ser valorizados. Refer\u00eancias Bibliogr\u00e1ficas BUNDESAMT F\u00dcR KARTOGRAPHIE UND GEOD\u00c4SIE.

As supposedly the approving authority, local government units are not requiring comprehensive detailed engineering before a subdivision development project is given the License To Sell. Can we attribute this to lack of competence or shall we say, corruption in government? If I may, I shall say both.</span><br/><br/><span>Flood mitigation is always on top of the list for a project to comply with in order to ensure public safety. As one of the bases of detailed engineering, topographic map shall always be as accurate as providing the designer/planner not only actual ground relief but also actual gravitation in the project area. Achieving the required accuracy is hitting the first base towards flood mitigation. In view of this, geoid modelling is thus required for every topo project. Effective watershed analysis shall only provide meaningful result if it is based on meaningful accurate topo map. Is geoid modelling accomplished in local practice? Of course not! How can then flooding be avoided?</span><br/><br/><span>On the other hand, mining industry is being castigated by politicians as one of the main causes of flooding. In my opinion, it is the incompetence of regulating government agencies and the corruption in government are two main causes. As professional engineers, the concerned approving officers should have at least the required credentials. Incompetence in government is I guess one of the culprits of failure to safeguard public safety contrary to what politicians are saying in TV/radio. Incompetence invites corruption to come in. What disturbs me a lot is the incompetent government regulating incompetent small scale miners.</span><br/><br/><span>Other issues in flood mitigation is hydrology. How can the brightest hydrologist come up with meaningful hydrologic model if accurate meaningful topo map is not present?</span><br/><br/><span>In my opinion, flooding will continue to occur until incompetence and corruption in government are effectively addressed.

After the rough grading process and catch basins and curbs on islands have been installed, the fine grading of the sub-base and ABC are a calculation-time consuming process. There is no need for it to be. The trick of this calculation formula is there isn't any calc's necessary---REALLY! This is a method I have used for 15 years even though my LS boss once said in shock \"You can't do that\"----so much for the dumb boss! Here is how it works. Once you understand it you will see it can be used to stake curbs and pipe lines also. There are a lot of tricks you will learn about it also once you start using it. I'm going to give you a simple example of use: Let's say we want to blue top ABC from a drop inlet drain over to a curb line 60 feet away. Take your self leveling level and set it up on the\u00a0 near edge of the drop inlet to the line you intend to stake. Align two of the leveling screws 90 degrees to the line your staking. Level the instrument. Let's assume the paving thickness is 6 inches and curb height is 6 inches. Take your LINKER ROD and unlock the tape. Set the rod next to your level eye end and set the RED X\u00a0 5 tenths (6 inches paving thickness) above it. Lock\u00a0the LINKER ROD tape. Now have your rodman take the LINKER over to the curb and set the rod on top of the curb. Focus on the rod and look for the RED X. Move ONLY the leveling screw (the third screw) on the stake line. Notice each time you move it up towards the RED X it will relevel. After a time it will \"STICK\"and you continue to screw it upwards until the cross hair is on 1 foot below the RED X (6 inches of curb and 6 inches paving). You have successfully raised the blue top grade line to \"EYE\" level. Now have the rodman walk on the line towards the insturment stopping wherever you want a blue top stake. Look for the red x noting how much your rod reading is above or below it. That is your cut or fill or how much you need to move the stake up or down to bring it to grade. Put as many stakes in as you want---no calculations. Move to another location and do it all over again. You will grade a very crazy paving surface with little or no effort. Have fun.

We were hired to do some topo work for a potential underground mine shaft opening. The area consisted of a 1 or 2 acre bottom, a small creek or drain and slope of the hill. My crew and I began cutting some brush around the small creek so we could get the necessary shots when my machete struck something with a \"thud\". My machete had struck a plastic five gallon bucket with a peculiar plant growing from it. Upon further notice there were ten or twelve plastic buckets with peculiar plants growing from them (marijuana). After looking at these for a moment we decided to continue our work and get out of there.\u00a0A few days later one of my crew members was in his dad's office (sheriff's department investigator) and some of the deputies came in. My crew and myself have known these deputies since High School and they asked Dan \"so, what did you guys think of that marijuana you found the other day\"? Dan's reply was of shock because neither Dan or the rest of us told anybody. He replied \"we weren't sure what to think, how did you know about that\"?

Perhaps I should have mentioned that I'm not using the Sokkia in conjunction with the Carlson.

I did balance the angles and the closure was a little better in one direction. I actually used a different total station for the remaining 3/4 of the traverse after the bad closure the first time and am wondering if that might have something to do with it. I expect to get the original one back this week and haven't heard the results of the calibration check yet. I did remeasure a few of the distances to compare the two and got anywhere from 2 to 6 hundredths difference in some legs that were 2000 feet and even longer in length.

I believe I understand what you're saying about the propagation of parallelism. It's not too difficult when working in a 2 dimensional world but when you add the geoid, scale factor, convergence and mix gps with cadastral surveying it gets much more complicated. As for the advise to transform local to grid that is where it gets out of control. I don't know of a method, formula or program to help with that. I think that I can take the northing and easting of each coordinate and apply the scale factor to adjust the ones needed but that gets kind of complicated and time consuming and I'm not really sure that I am doing that correctly. I have several other ideas like creating a duplicate file (to experiment with and not screw up the good file) and trying to change the scale factor to generate new coordinates but haven't tried that yet. I was hoping to find a program that would do that and have been all over the internet hunting unsuccessfully so far. There's some great tools available at the NGS site but none apply to adjusting coordinates from local to grid that I can find. One adjust from UTM to other systems but not local (or in my mind ground). I've got a few weeks to explore and think about it. You are right on with the idea that I need to somehow transform from ground to grid correctly before I can even adjust.

Managing scale factor is not the only issue with regards to your situation. You also need to manage convergence issues. Please take note that everytime backsight measurement is performed, you are propagating parallelism of orientation project wide contrary to the idea of being local with covergence values everywhere.","createdDate":"2010-12-05T13:59:49.771Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:31588","contributorName":"3q02ul8dm7qy6","description":"Mark, I have worked with sokkia gps before and have seen many problems with the gps used with the carlson. The geoid has to be updated constantly or you will bad data. A way to check that is to set the gps on a known usgs monument and check the hieght. If it is, then you may have a Geiod issue. I had to can the Sokkia I was working because of the geiod issue. When it was busy, it made me mad when I had to get job complete and the GPS was not working.\n\nAnother thing you can do is check your post process of your control. If your setup allows a lot of poor data then you may have an issue with the post process setup. I don't see this happening, but it could.\n\n\n\nWith your legg that was out, did you bablance your angles and re-check the closure? If the closure gets worse, then it will be an angle issue. If the closure is better, then it probably is a GPS issue.\n\n\nThis is just my experience.

I was contracted to survey approximately 1000 acres to be divided into 8 parcels. It is in 3 sections and there are numerous parcels within that are owned by other individuals therefore leaving several cutouts within (sort of irrelevant really). Two of the sections border a highway and there are dirt roads and trail roads around the 2 sections that are open and drivable. Some of the property is wide open where GPS would work great but most areas are densely wooded and require \"conventional\" total station traverse methods. My plan was to get GPS coordinates at the beginning and end of the traverse along the open highway on the North side and use the total station to traverse from one to the other and use the GPS control for a closure check. The same procedure in a few \"GPS friendly\" openings on the South side of the 2 sections. The traverse was about 2 miles long on the North side, along the highway so I set 2 GPS points on the West end at about 2000 feet apart that I used for the beginning and a third at the East end of the 2 miles that I used for the end. I occupied one of the 2 at the beginning and backsighted the other and proceeded to traverse toward the third from West to East. I only had 5 legs in this traverse. When I closed into the third point at the East end I was out about 0.5 feet for line and about 1 foot for distance. Yikes. Although when I thought about it I had about a 1/10,000 closure. Not great but better than the 1/5000 required for \"open rural\" surveys. I did not set collect or \"rep\" the angles as I was going to have a closure check at the end and have never had any big problems with accuracy in the past. GPS is giving \"grid distance and the total station was giving \"ground\" distance. Right? So I applied a scale factor calculation to the distances and came in within a few hundredths of a foot. Wow! Didn't help with angular closure and boy I sure wished I had \"repped\" those angles. Well there was plenty more work still left to do so I thought I would address that situation later and proceeded to run another traverse around a 1 mile square that I could easily run down the open dirt roads. The roads had a few curves and angle points so I ended up with a 19 leg traverse that was run with the total station only. No GPS involved at all. I could have used GPS for some of the traverse but most of it was under dense canopy and I also had to locate the road and various fences so I only used the total station, especially since I only have static GPS equipment. When I made the closure I was out 0.90 feet in a North and South direction and 0.36 feet East and West. Dang it! After the crappy results I got with the first traverse I decided to \"rep\" those angles and collected 2 sets of \"repped\" angles at each setup. So that entire traverse was run with only the total station. I'm sure it was functioning well as it had only been about 4 months since it was last calibrated and I take very good care of my instruments. Only the total station was used so therefore the grid factor wasn't an issue. The traverse was about 4 miles in length so I had roughly a 1/24,000 closure. Better than the previous traverse. I can perform an adjustment, and I will, but in the past I have ran traverses that long and closed within a tenth or maybe 3 tenths at the worst (tempting to not even worry with adjustment). Like I said I don't believe there was a problem with the \"gun\" but have sent it in for a checkup since I do have a \"spare\". Just wondering if anyone had any tips or tricks or advise? Maybe I'm getting old and I know my eyesight isn't what it once was but I can still see the hair on a fly's leg at 150 feet. HA. Does anyone know about the grid or scale factor issue? Has anyone else experienced the same problem? I have static Sokkia GPS equipment and am sure the processing was done correctly. I know the scale factor can be changed in my data collector to compensate for the ground verses grid distance difference but I've never had that problem before and believed the difference to be a fairly small value. I don't know everything about GPS but I've had the 3 Sokkias for about 5 years now with no problems and have learned quite a bit. I have compared the distances between GPS and the total station before and noticed that it never checks perfectly. I have always gotten anywhere from about 0.06 feet to about 0.10 of a foot difference in 600 foot to 2500 foot lengths when comparing the two but have never actually used GPS combined with the total station for a closure until now. I have also never thought about the scale factor being an issue either. I use a Carlson Explorer data collector with the SurvCE software and always leave the scale factor set at 1.00000 although I do check the box allowing for the curvature of the earth for some reason. I collected 2 sets of doubled angles which actually gives the mean of 4 angles. I suppose I could have collected 6 sets but don't feel that would have helped much. I welcome any comments, advise or even criticism. Adjusting distances from grid to ground or vice versa is fairly simple but does anyone know of a formula or a program that converts coordinates from ground to grid and vice versa?","createdDate":"2010-12-05T05:47:50.215Z"}]},{"id":"544331:Group:31432","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","title":"India Geomatics","description":"<p>Geomatics and Land Surveying Support in the Country of India.

Currently we have data phones with Sprint and At&amp;T that we use for working on the CSDS VSN RTK network and our Trimble Access data transfer. They work pretty well but have noticed that the AT&amp;T phone will drop the connection more often. The story I heard is that with all millions of smart phones out there, the providers data networks are getting overwhelmed and drop the data over voice. It is proving to be a problem in our LA office, and are probably going to switch over to a WiFi connection instead. We also have a Sprint MiFi card that allows use to connect using WiFi instead of a cellular modem. The slick thing about it is that will host up to 5 mobile devices at once, which may be your best bet to cover all of your needs. The connection works great and download speeds are pretty amazing for mobile PC use. The only down side is that the battery life is limited to about 4hrs of continuous data streaming, so buy the extra car charger.\n\nTo set it up in your DC, you need to create a connection in your Windows Mobile Settings -&gt; connections -&gt; add a new modem connection. You need to know the dialing string for your provider. If you are running Trimble Survey Controller, the set up is under the Configuration -&gt; Dial Profiles. You will need to know your IP address and port. After all that, you need to assign that dial profile to your survey style under Configuration -&gt; Survey Styles -&gt; (select your VSN RTK style or create one) -&gt; Rover Radio -&gt; Dial Profile.\n\nBest best is to contact the guys over at CSDS (California Surveying and Drafting Supply, <a href=\"http://csdsinc.com/\">http://csdsinc.com/</a>) and they'll take care of all your CA VSN RTK network needs.\" <a href=\"http://californiasurveyors.org/clsaforum/showthread.php?t=3410\" target=\"_blank\">via</a>\nand these two documents which look like they may be helpful too:\n<embed src=\"http://embedit.in/ds4TWNh5Rq.swf\" height=\"400\" width=\"466\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"never\"></embed>\n\ni will look for some more options as well...hope this helps","createdDate":"2010-07-25T03:57:29.378Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:22243","contributorName":"1zpy6f9e6xd5k","description":"Who do you know that can email regarding what phone to use and how to set it up to communicated to my RTK?

The charging and connection piggyback unit that comes with it will allow me to use the unit with my Total Station and does have the cursed DB9 serial connection and other connections that will allow me to go from the piggyback to a PC with a usb or serial but not at the same time as the radio. I have seen the PM3 work with the Bluetooth and that is the way I suspect that I could get a connection to a cell phone internet.\n\nOpps, I just realized that you are saying that I will not be using my mickey mouse radios and that maybe the GPS PM3 units will somehow connect to my notebook and the notebook with your NTRIP software will immulate the radio using the internet to transfer data back and forth to a nearby internet connected transmitter.

I agree that educating the public is the key however the gist of the article is it may be time to examine the rules I mention to bring them in line with what the public expects while at the same time informing them of the limitations of the information a Land Surveyor provides in a Land Survey. The average person who looks at a Land Survey and sees the area 1.00 acres or a square footage does not realize that the area expression they are looking at is limited by a Board rule. On the other hand most average people who see an area expressed \"1.0000 acres more or less\" or \"square feet more or less\" understand that the expression IS LIMITED even though they have not read the Board rule or grasp what the actual limits of that type of expression imply.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for the great response!

This is the way I explain it to title companies, realtors and in some instances municipal staff. First let us suppose that the linear error of closure on a figure that is 10,000 perimeter feet is 0.05 feet. Most surveyors would enjoy having an error of closure of 1:200,000 to report to their clients. That 0.05-foot error could be in either direction since it is a random error (assuming that the systematic errors have been accounted for before its computation). The area of the error is 0.05 feet times 10,000 or +/-500 square feet. So if the figure surveyed is square or 2,500 linear feet per side its area is about 143-1/2 acres with a known error of about 1,000 square feet. One would be kidding himself to report square footage to anything more precise. How does one accomplish reporting this mathematically?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>TSPS notwithstanding, the area precision is actually half of the precision as determined linearly (mathematical proofs are available). So for a linear closure of 1:200,000 the area precision is 1:100,000. Using the same figure above the area error would mathematically be up to +/-62.5 square feet. One could state that the area embraced by the field notes in his description contained 6,250,000 square feet with an actual area of 63 square feet more or less than that reported. Play with the language but we now know that we cannot determine land areas to the nearest square foot in most cases and need to persuade people requesting such that they are asking for the impossible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the tract gets smaller, the least count (integer of measurement) limits precision so achieving the 1:200,000 level of precision linearly becomes unattainable. The absolute area precision doesn\u2019t get down to a single square foot until the figure is about the size of a residence and even then it is questionable that it is reproducible. One can also develop similar algorithms to quantify area from positional tolerances.</p>","createdDate":"2012-06-29T19:06:11.268Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:105844","contributorName":"3ct0ly8ylw9az","description":"<p>Deward Bowles posted an essay about area precision on May 12, 2011, which I just read. In his essay Deward posed a question about how to report areas. He referenced the Texas Board of Professional Surveyor\u2019s Rule 663.15 (d). I found the quoted rule under 663.11. Precision and Accuracy as, \u201cSurvey measurement shall be made with equipment and methods of practice capable of attaining the accuracy and tolerances required by the professional surveying services being performed. Ares, if reported, shall be produced, recited, and/or shown only to the least significant number compatible with the precision of closure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Reporting area has been an interesting topic since my earliest days of surveying. From my profile one can see that I started surveying using Peter\u2019s 8-Place Trig Tables and filling out DMD spreadsheets. One\u2019s ability to produce area calculations to several places right of the decimal was limited by the display on the rotary calculator. Very few people in my mentorship were familiar with significant digits in those early days. I was a math major at the University of Houston so I found myself trying to explain a concept to old sage surveyors who found the topic less than interesting and bordering on treason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later when I got involved with writing computer software with Holguin and Clark out of El Paso, Texas, we had high-precision trig functions and double-precision numeric digits. The programs simply used all of the precision available and the round-off was left to the user. Once again I tried to persuade surveyors to limit the reporting of square footage based on the precision of their measurements but measurement precision was highly subjective since no one was doing statistical analysis of their measurements. At that point most surveyors still held to the mistaken opinion that their chained closures were precise beyond reason. We would see \u201cError of Closure\u201d on a loop that was 1:25,000 and believe that the error propagation was minimal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once I was introduced to a network least squares method of measurement analysis it became patently obvious that my conventional surveying with total stations was far inferior to my earlier belief. I spent years working with ways to improve the positional tolerance for my survey stations. Introduction of GPS vectors to create high-precision connections between remote stations proved to be the only method available to achieve the results that many standards required. The precision of area is exaggerated by the square of the error so for all of those older loops my areas were far from being the number of square feet implied by the arithmetic.</p>","createdDate":"2012-06-29T19:05:37.647Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:44958","contributorName":"2cn2zqib4lzuc","description":"I added a feed of Videos tagged \"Tx\" to this group so in the future please tag all photos, videos and discussions that you'd like to show up in the Texas Surveyors Group with the tag: Tx","createdDate":"2011-06-25T00:37:03.462Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:40849","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"<p>Chain!</p>\n<p>Under the \u00a0(1) Texas Administrative\u00a0Code, Title 22, Part 28, Chapter 663,\u00a0Subchapter B, Rule 663.15 (d), we\u00a0find the statement \u2015Areas, if reported,\u00a0shall be produced, recited, and/or\u00a0shown only to the least significant\u00a0number compatible with the precision\u00a0of closure.\u2016Certainly area would be the least reliable product as a result of actual field\u00a0measurements and we can all understand the basis for the reasoning behind such a rule. It follows that when\u00a0expressing area it is prudent that it\u00a0should be noted in a manner that allows the public to be able to understand the limitations of this product.The reality of practice however is an\u00a0entirely different matter. Often area is\u00a0required to be noted on Land Surveyor\u2018s products within the nearest\u00a0square foot (2) by various local governmental entities. This is particularly true\u00a0for urban areas where parcel sizes\u00a0average in the range of 5,000 square\u00a0feet. \u00a0Lot coverage, building coverage\u00a0and other matters make the area expression a critical issue for development of small parcels in an urban\u00a0setting.This question of how to satisfy board\u00a0rules and the rules of local government entities is aggravated by an apparent typographical error in (3) Chapter 663.18 (2), which states the Land\u00a0Surveyor \u2015shall abide by, and conform\u00a0to, the provisions of the state code\u00a0and any local codes and ordinances\u00a0not consistent with this Act.\u2016The Land Surveyor is faced with a\u00a0certain dichotomy and this has resulted in various attempts to try and\u00a0satisfy both the need to comply with\u00a0the board rule and the need to comply\u00a0with the local governmental entities\u00a0requirements. \u00a0For example, I recently\u00a0found a subdivision map that reported the area\u00a0of a parcel expressed as 0.948 acres\u00a0(41,300 square feet). Here the area\u00a0has been expressed as a fraction of\u00a0acreage complies with the Board Rule,\u00a0the area as expressed in square feet\u00a0does not. \u00a0There are many examples of\u00a0this and it is not my intention to attack\u00a0the Land Surveyor nor am I suggesting\u00a0they have done anything wrong.Area expressed to the nearest square\u00a0foot is actually helpful in many situations from the stand point of the Land\u00a0Surveyor because it introduces an\u00a0extra tool by which typographical errors in written or mapped land descriptions can be trapped. I have often\u00a0been able to resolve ambiguities in\u00a0written descriptions and maps as a\u00a0result of having the scrivener or\u00a0drafter express the area to the nearest\u00a0square foot. For example a transposition error of a number or letter can be\u00a0indentified and corrected by exploring\u00a0the product of the ambiguity, computing the resulting areas and comparing\u00a0that with the area in the description.\u00a0The problem with placing limitations\u00a0on how area is expressed is compounded by the hypocrisy that there\u00a0are no such limitations placed on how\u00a0distance or angles are expressed. All\u00a0of these elements are part of a description, why put limitations on how\u00a0one element is expressed when the\u00a0other elements do not have any such\u00a0limitations? \u00a0Are not all measurements\u00a0expressed subject to similar limitations in precision?Clearly arguments on either side of the\u00a0issue of how area should be expressed by a Land Surveyor can be\u00a0compelling\u00a0My answer has been to rely on the\u00a0Texas Supreme Court case of \u00a0Bickler\u00a0v. Bickler, 403 S.W.Wd 354 which\u00a0stated that \"Words \"more or less\"\u00a0when used in conveyance to qualify\u00a0statements of quantity and descriptive\u00a0calls for distance function to relieve\u00a0exactness.\"\u00a0Thus a boundary survey report prepared by me always contains the\u00a0statement \u2015more or less\u2016 when it\u00a0comes to the expression of area to the\u00a0nearest square foot. The reasoning\u00a0being that I believe a credible argument can be made that by using the\u00a0term \u2015more or less\u2016, as defined by the\u00a0Texas Supreme Court, I have complied\u00a0with the intent of the board rule regarding area expression. This also\u00a0allows me to make an equally credible\u00a0argument that I have also complied\u00a0with local governmental entities rules\u00a0who desire area to be expressed by\u00a0the Land Surveyor to the nearest\u00a0square foot.Regardless of how one views this issue the time may have come for the\u00a0individual Land Surveyor and the\u00a0Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying to revisit the Board rules mentioned above.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Come Ahead!</p>","createdDate":"2011-05-12T18:43:40.918Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:33486","contributorName":"3013v5tnzvpnw","description":"<p><a target=\"_self\" href=\"groups/373-th_IM000058.jpg\"><img width=\"160\" src=\"groups/374-th_IM000058.jpg\" class=\"align-right\"/></a>Here is a photo of a City of Houston Street Reference Monument at the intersection of North Main and Quitman.

I am almost 55 now and have worked in the field of surveying since I was 12 years old. Those were only a few brief work experinces until I graduated from high school in 1973 and have been employed in the field ever since. I have been licensed since 1998 and used what was called a \"chain\" although it was truly an engineers chain. In reality it was a 100 foot steel tape of which there are a few types. We called it chaining and the term chaining pin was used but it was not made up of links like the original Gunthers chain. It is my understanding that the original geodetic surveyors would sometimes use taping \"stools\" as well as a tension guage and thermometer. There are many corrections that must be applied when accurately chaining that were not used or really necessary when the gunther chain was the only device available. I doubt there are any surveyors still alive that have used a true Gunthers chain to much extent and very few of the new generation are skillful at even using a plumb bob for anything other than a spear. Since the advent of the distance measuring devices it is not very productive to teach anyone or even use a \"chain\" or steel tape. I will occaisionally use a steel tape for measuing certain things within less than 100 feet. I remember feeling very confident that our measurements were highly accurate but since have remeasured some of the more lengthy lines with a modern total station and realized how inaccurate the measurements really are, sometimes being a foot or two off when they were 3000 to 5000 feet in length. I would like to pose a simple question for the members and ask for comments on why the \"chained\" measurements consitently check as being short when measured with a distance meter or total station?","createdDate":"2010-06-14T10:13:34.402Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:19662","contributorName":"1m2dr5qvmy2ve","description":"amazing....sure wish you had some photos from back then Phil...it would be interesting if we could make a series of tutorial videos on How to Chain Measure...the problem is....where do we get a chain?","createdDate":"2010-06-10T14:26:58.042Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:19610","contributorName":"3ci4753gge739","description":"In the late summer of 1971 it was hotter than blazes as we ran traverse in Quang Tri Province, Vietnam. Our survey chief was known to us as Indian Territory because he was famous for saying, \"Saddle up, boys, we're headed for Indian Territory!\"\n\nHe came from setting up range poles out in front of us to check on our most recent measurements. The traverse legs were measured with a 30 meter steel tape using chaining pins. The crew reported distance and the recorder reported the last angle I turned. Indian Territory said, \"That distance is wrong. You dropped a pin.\" They asked how he knew. His response was that he stepped off the distance and knew what it ought to be.\n\nThey made the mistake of telling him he could not know they were wrong by stepping off the distance. The end result is that we all got to practice chaining that traverse leg and were sent back to chain it again when we did not match each other well enough to suit him.\n\nI learned a lot of good lessons that day. I was 19 years old, cocky, and bullet proof. But I learned that old man was serious and correct when he made bold statements.

The data being reported on a BLM or GLO Cadastral Survey plat are, of course, bearings and distances. But bearings and distances with reference to what? The current BLM Manual of Surveying Instructions, 1973 states:\n\n<u><i><b>\"2-1. The law prescribes the chain as the unit of linear measure for the survey of the public lands. All returns of measurements in the rectangular system are made in the true horizontal distance in miles, chains and links....\"\n\n\"2-17. The direction of each line of the public land surveys is determined with reference to the true meridian as defined by the axis of the earth's rotation. Bearings are stated in terms of angular measure referred to the true north or south.\"\n\n\"2-74. .... By basic law and the Manual requirements, the directions of all lines are stated in terms of angular measure referred to the true north (or south) at the point of record.\"\n\n\"Distances. These and other references in the BLM and GLO Manuals make it clear that the frame of reference for distances is defined as horizontal measure in chains based on the U.S. Survey Foot at actual ground elevation. This is of importance when performing computations in projections or at sea-level when the actual lines are at a significant elevation. If you are computing proportions in a projection, the variation of elevation over a project can have a small effect, the elevation difference in essence weights the record ground measurements. This usually is a small effect unless the lines differ in elevation by a 1000 ft. or so.\nBearings: The above Manual sections and others identify the frame of reference for direction as something called 'Mean True Bearings' referenced to the true astronomic meridian '..at the point of record.' For those of you familiar with basic geodesy you will recognize that this is a basis of bearing that changes as you go east and west since the reference meridians are not parallel but converge towards the pole.\"</b></i></u>\n\n\"Because this is a changing reference, the direction of a straight line on the ground can be described with a forward bearing based on the meridian at the beginning end, or with a differing back bearing based on the meridian at the end point. The difference between them is the angle of convergency of the two meridians. If we want to accurately describe how far north or west the line goes in a geodetic sense, we need to use the average or 'mean' of these two values. This 'mean bearing' is essentially identical to the bearing of the traverse line with reference to it's midpoint. Thus the 'point of record' for determining the bearing of a straight traverse line can be said to be the meridian at the midpoint of the line.\n\nStraight Lines: Therefore, one unusual byproduct of the PLSS datum is that:\n\n<u><i><b>Straight lines on the ground are lines of constantly changing bearing.</b></i></u>\n\nA straight line is basically what you would lay out by double centering or projecting a direct line of sight. The only straight line that does have a constant bearing is the meridian or north and south line. An example of a boundary that might be a straight line is one that is described as a straight line running from one physical monument to another. Such a line, if reported in the PLSS Datum would have different forward and back bearings, and different bearings at each point along it.\n\nRhumb Lines: It is also apparent from the various GLO and BLM Survey Manuals and the actual methods that were used to lay out the public land surveys that most boundary lines in the PLSS are intended not to be straight lines but lines of constant bearing or Rhumb Lines. Such lines cross every meridian at the same angle and are thus curved as viewed on the ground.\n\n<u><i><b>Therefore, another unusual byproduct of the 'PLSS datum' is that:\n\nLines of constant bearing are curved lines on the ground.\nFor example, the solar compass and transit were instruments that determined bearing at each setup, and when matched with traditional chaining, measured or laid out lines of constant bearing.</b></i></u>\n\nsomething else that I re-learned while re reading the article... Mercy it is kind of complex, but im enjoying this.\n\nThe 'Manual' discussion of latitudinal arcs illustrate one example of a rhumb line. A parallel of latitude is a line that is due East and West in the PLSS Datum. Since it crosses each meridian at a 90 degree angle, it has a mean bearing of East or West. Lines of constant bearing in the PLSS datum will appear curved on the ground. It also turns out that the mean bearing of any chord or sub-chord connecting any two points along such a line is the same as the bearing of the rhumb line itself. Thus it is possible to lay out points on a rhumb line by correcting traverse lines to their mean bearing in computations.\"\n\nI actually forgot about the CURVED East West Lines.. this was a major discussion that was discussed on another message board, come to find out the error produced by using Horizontal lines VS CURVED lines was about the size of a finger nail. kind of made it a mute discussion in my opinion, but good to know for testing purposes.\n\nAgain Gary thanks for bringingthis to LSU!

Find the mid point of both lines and place a mark to identify it. You then draw a line Cardinal (not perpendicular or parralel) directions east or west from the north south line (depending on where the mid point of the east/west line is.) Then draw a line from the mid point of the East/West line Due North or South to make an intersection. it is usually 1' to 5', possibly more as the crow flies from the intersection of your 2 original lines.\n\nWhere these 2 lines intersect is your double porportionate calc point.\n\nalot of people still use total station and assumed bearings, and it is difficult to find cardinal directions, i have tried it both ways with gps and total station, drawing with ortho on in cad, and it doesnt really make that much difference. I dont want to sound sloppy, but if you were using total staion and wanted to use true cardinal directions for your double porp. point, you could traverse from 2 known monuments with a published Geodetic, or Grid AZ between them, or take a sun shot or observe polaris.\n\ni really dont think and havent seen this yet, much error or differerence by using ortho in cad with or without gps.\n\nI have seen some sections that had internal angles at the section corners of 88 or 87 degrees, i could see this being a problem, and would take alot more care in trying to establish a true Azimuth/Bearing, before double porportioning.\n\nin this case, i have put a lot of thought into this, because the blm notes say these lines are very close to cardinal directions in this case, but the usgs 7.5 min topo's and measurements clearly show the skewed angles (dont get me wrong i dont rely on the usgs maps alone to determine this, but i do know they have been measureing these lines over and over for many years). In restoring corners, it almost seems to me going perpendicular would put the corner closer to its true location than going cardinal directions (otherwise it would put a major P.I. in the line, which is common but not that much of a P.I.). I havent found any info in my studies or research that show a good scenerio of this. However what i have explained above is how the BLM instructs us to do it\n\nthankfully, i have always been able to replace a section corner monument with confidence by research, witness corners and interior corners etc, in this particular case.\n\nhats off to you for your efforts to bring these subjects alive!

I will plan to work with other surveyors to do this later as I learn to use the LSU resources to help myself and help others prepare for Land Surveyors Exams. We need to have better access to resources for practical use of methods, old and new that can sometimes be difficult to find in writing and with plenty of graphics. We need them so that we can \"see\" them better and embed tried and true methods in our memory for use forever.\n\nI plan to write or assemble information on \"Level Loops\" also. I have witnessed some real lack of knowledge and experience out their in the field over the years with up and coming new land surveyors. School book education is not providing the open resources needed to preserve tried and true methods and move forward with methods that are logical and applicable for the tried and true technological equipment and systems out there. Also there is a very large educational gap that started back in the 1970's that all but eliminated the principle of apprenticeship and practical consideration of the real world in the field. The gap between field surveying and \"office surveying\" has become greater. It is now more common and controlled by the same to the destruction of common sense that is killing real surveyors.\n\nI have recently gone through \"hell\" by those who have little practical knowledge and understanding of real world surveying. Those that control our existence as surveyors who support their families are creating rules and mis-using their positions to eliminate us for their power and greed. We real surveyors work our asses off trying to provide our clients with what they need to solve their land and asset location problems or plan for improvements. Real surveyors like what they do because they serve a very good purpose. Even though most of us \"dirt surveyors\" are treated like dirt we usually work till we are buried in it. Most outsiders do not understand when they discover how little payment and appreciation we get for our hard work and intense management of resources necessary to provide those services. There is hope and it can be found at LSU for real surveyors, by real surveyors, and for the good of all together with those landowners we serve.\n\nI have been surveying since age 14 back in 1965 and was introduced to Section Surveying out in the Boonies where my first job was to clear line and hold the dumb end of that steel tape that we still call the survey chain. The surveys were done over very rough isolated terrain and thickly forested areas around Lake Keystone near my home town of Sand Springs, Oklahoma. I did not know the mechanics of how and where we got our information to base our lines and corners at that time. I imagine that someone at the Corps assembled information or contracted Surveying-Engineering Companies and individuals to collect and organize the section data as it was obtained. At that time, I became aware that USGS topo maps that the \u201cold timers\u201d carried with us in the field were one of the mapping resources that were often used to find and design the boundary around the Lake.\n\nThe work was for the Corps of Engineers through my dad's Engineering Company, Breisch Engineering Company back then. I recall soon after I started working in the field that we got what was called a Geodometer device that would measure across the lake over a mile or two in some cases using light waves and frequencies. Perhaps I will write a whole article on that subject later. It was truly as complicated to use as with what we call modern day GPS equipment and few really understood how it worked.

You can find out which bootloader is installed by clicking Help &gt; Receiver Identification in RxControl and locating the Bootloader filename.\n\n2) If possible, please have the APS-3 on external 12v power while doing firmware upgrades. If not, like Paul mentioned, please ensure your batteries are fully charged.\n\n3) USB-to-Serial adapters do work for communication, however, some work much better than others with the APS-3/RxTools package.

The proposed railway corridor needs to be designed after doing the detailed topographical survey</p>\n<p>The first step followed is : Established 85 pairs of control points (say GPS1 to GPS 85) along the corridor using DGPS.</p>\n<p>Second step: Convert the control point LLH (Lat,Lon,Ht) to grid coordinates (XYZ) based on UTM projection system</p>\n<p>Third step: Convert grid coordinates to Local coordinates using one step transformation with the method - One point localization. Here the localization base is one of the GPS stations (say GPS 83). During one point localization the ground coordinates (i.e Position &amp; Height (P&amp;H)) of all control points are derived w.r.t GPS 83 . Here the paramters for one point localization such as Flase easting,False Northing etc are set using UTM easting and northing of GPS83.</p>\n<p>My question :</p>\n<p>1. For a linear project of 260 km long, is it a right approach to create ground coordinates of all DGPS control points w.r.t to GPS 83 (which is at one end of the corridor)\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Second question is, should multiple DGPS control points (use their UTM grid coordinates) be used for localization which may be spread out in the 260km long corridor</p>\n<p>3.

This isn't a comment but rather a question that I hoped would spark some comment. How many of you guys often clear line by hand with a machete, sometimes for days? I prefer a machete to a bush axe due to the convenience, weight and less labor involved. It is less labor intensive to swing a machete all day than a bush axe. We usually only have a 2 man crew and have other tools we must carry through the woods (total station, prism rod, magnetic locator, shovel, data collector, field book, measuring tapes, flag stakes, flagging and nails) without having to make the, sometimes could be a mile long trip back to the work vehicle.

So, don't breach the contract, merely amend the contract, to deal with changing conditions.\n\nOne last factoid: in many states to bring suit against a land surveyor, requires another land surveyor or engineer licensed to practice, certifying the validity of the claim, so make sure your field notes, ascii and raw files are in order, timestamped and LS stamped.\n\nOf all the things I have learned in heavy construction three stand out: be honest, if you screw up fix it fast and trade survey time for any costs associated with the screwup, dont let them gold plat the extra, if the do, you goldplate them, that is the rule of engagement.\nSecond, dress and act like other heavy constrution crew, try not to stand out, \"the nail that stands up, get hammered down\" (Japanese proverb)\nIn other words become like all the other smurfs, and give Papa smurf his due respect (General Contractor)\nAnd lastly, when in a corner, have a joke ready to disarm the situation, haveing good humor and honesty has saved me literally tens of thousands of dollars in backcharge fees.

But there have been occaisions (especially with pilings for some reason) when a contractor will call after noticing a problem and accuse the surveyor of staking points in the wrong position. Of course when you go back to check your work all the stakes are gone and there is no proof that anything was done incorrectly. Niether party can prove the other is or is not at fault and of course the surveyor gets the blame. You can go over the procedure and whip out the raw data but none of this proves the stakes where set in the correct position. You could have actually made an error or something else could have happened. During the actual construction things can get very hectic. There are cranes and trackhoes and dump trucks and drill rigs and front end loaders and concrete trucks and concrete pumps and laborers and traffic all throughout the site. No one can and doesn't watch everything that's going on and a stake or two gets knocked over or ran over or dug up and someone might get angry or fired if they saw who did it so it just gets stuck back at about where it was located before it got torn out. Then someone uses it and doesn't notice or doesn't care that it is kind of dirty or leaning over or the writing is on the wrong side or it is broken or something looks suspicious about it. Sometimes they might call for someone (you or me) to come out and check it or the right person may not have been told and it gets used anyway, say to drill and pour a caisson. Then they come along and try to layout pile caps or footers or place rebar and something doesn't fit right. So then they start to measure and notice something is in the wrong place. What do they do next? BLAME THE SURVEYOR! So they call you up and say that you have staked a $20,000 caisson in the wrong position. What do you do? Accept the blame and pay for it? Deny that you have done anything wrong? Can you prove you staked all points in the correct position? You can explain your procedure and the control used and go over the raw data and the plans but none of this actually proves that the points were actually set correctly. You might have the burden of proof if things were bad enough and it went to court. How would you prove to a judge that all your work was correct? I employ a few methods of checking my work and recording the checks in case such a problem does arise. It's just too easy to blame the surveyor when there is a problem with something he was responsible for and may have actually made a mistake. In this case he should own up to it and take the blame and suffer the consequences although, since the stake is gone, it might be tempting to lie and say that no error in staking was found. I'm sure everyone else is as careful as I am and just as confident in thier work but just wondering what methods others use to check thier stakeout work. Arnel mentioned his method of verifying some of the lot corners, especially the first, then proceeds with sideshots for his boundary relocation surveys. Michael records his backsight and every stakeout point then his backsight again, I guess at the end of the procedure. This would be proof that the angles were all set correctly and the correct occupy and backsight points were used. Do you do all your calcs? What if one or more of the points were calced wrong? As long as you kept using that incorrect point then everything would check. What if one or more points were set at the correct angle but at a bad distance? (hard to do when using a data collector and staking to a point but I have seen it happen depending on the methods used) Storing the stakeout point as a new point is proof and a very good idea but what if you were occpying or backsighting the wrong point? Again a backsight check should prove things were correct but the occupied or backsight point could have been the wrong points and the backsight check would have worked. This is not likely but it is possible. I have seen a house staked out correctly but on the wrong lot when all the lots were dimensioned the same and someone didn't perform a check to make sure they were on the right lot. A simple building envelope can be checked by measuring the diagonals. That would ensure the envelope was square and at 90 degrees but wouldn't check where it was in relation to the lot lines or setback lines. I will check and record the diagonals but also measure (and record) to at least 2 of the property corners to ensure the building fits on the lot as it should. Of course in this competative environment you will have to absorb the extra time and cost to make these checks unless you can charge that to the client, which around here means you won't be getting much work when someone else does the job for less but it is something that I feel has to be done. I don't feel good about leaving a site and not being able to prove to a contactor or client or even a judge that all my work was done correctly. I have done a lot of construction stakeout and have been blamed for staking a few things wrong, most notably pilings and curb. Normally the pilings were in the wrong horizontal postion and the curb problems were mostly elevation (or grade). I have seen and made a few mistakes I must admit. This is an unfortunate way to learn to be careful. Has anyone ever had to pay for 1000 feet of curb and gutter that was staked incorrectly? Not only did I have to pay for it to be installed again but I also had to pay to have it torn out and disposed of. YIKES. Just a little advise and a reminder to be careful (I may be preaching to the chior, so to speak). I have one other method that I have used at times when setting quite a few points (not just a simple 4 corner building envelope although it would work). That is what I have seen termed an \"as staked\" location where the points are set and sometimes graded from one point and then located and checked again \"as staked\" from another point which veryfies that not only do they fit amongst themselves but that they are in the right position with respect to the boundary or right of way. But they could still have been calced incorrectly. Just wondering if anyone has any other methods or ideas as to how to check and prove thier work? I would certainly be interested to hear them.","createdDate":"2010-11-16T04:49:25.425Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:30118","contributorName":"2q0rjwdnfdvos","description":"For GPS RTK similar, however you can shoot control points after recording stakeout.","createdDate":"2010-11-15T22:32:44.824Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:30117","contributorName":"2q0rjwdnfdvos","description":"Concerning checking stakeout, I record backsight as a shot, and record every stakeout shot, then record again the backsight, and try to overlap some other shots with other setups, Then plot the values and see how the fit.","createdDate":"2010-11-15T22:31:06.656Z"},{"id":"544331:Comment:21713","contributorName":"3fcqbwga9unov","description":"Geodesy is always at work in every boundary relocation survey that I do.

I recently performed a property line stakeout at 200 foot intervals around the perimeter of a 15 acre parcel. I had previously performed a boundary survey utilizing existing openings as well as trial roads within the interior of the parcel and had a control traverse established but did not run the actual true lines. I staked the perimeter property lines at 200 foot intervals by using a Carlson data collector and the stakeout line function. I am sure I was using the correct point number and coordinate values for my control points and observed the fact that the stakeout points were falling at what represented the correct property lines but due the dense vegetation it was not feasible for me or my client to actually clear the true property lines nor was it possible to eyeball the stakes or the lines to visually verify the accuracy or correctness of the stakeout. I am entirely relying on a side shot without the benefit of having a check, other than running another independant traverse (again not feasible or within the budget for me or my client). Does anyone know of a method for checking such a procedure? I suppose I am not the only surveyor who has done such a thing. I am very confident in my ability and sure of the correctness of my work but would like to know how to prove this to someone else and myself, (heaven forbid a judge or court) other than using the raw data and field notes, if it became neccesary. The purpose of the survey was for the client to install a fence and the lines would eventually be cleared at which time the results would be visually apparent but it would be satisfying to know when I left the site that everything was exact and correct.

Trimble Base &amp; Rover Data Collector (DC) is Handheld unit that has a special high quality Rover Pole or Leg Mounting Quick Disconnect Bracket is used with the light weigh Trimble high strength carbon fiber Rover Pole with attachable bi-pod TSC2 with WiFi and Bluetooth so you can wirelessly communicate with both the Rover and Base GPS receivers and internet similar to a notebook computer. You can transfer files on it to an SD card with slots for other cards and USB drives and transfer data via the USB to a thumbdrive or by cable connection or via SD or other card options easily or via Bluetooth. The Data Collector has several amazing features such as Wifi and Bluetooth of course. It is labeled as a Trimble TSC2 with numbers at the connections at the base of the unit as 890-0038-XXQ SSC53A0160 - Inside the unit under the battery is RANGER X Series by Tripod Data Systems CE0981 Bluetooth N324 ST2-TY5GMDB SS53C12758 with the batter unit M890-0001 SSE07755.\n5.

I was able to get over 100 points in a very short time compared to my other GPS equipment around trees and other obstacles that the ProMark3RTK would have taken 5 to ten times the time or not been able to get enough signals to get a fix. Very fast and accurate.\nI was not able to figure out how to get the points or the topo that the Data Collector was able to display off of the unit into my computer AutoCAD or to download the csv type files yet. I worked several hours trying to figure out how to transfer that data from the DC memory to the USB thumbdrive that I found very handy to use. I was able to transfer the previous drawings and dxf data from the \u201cWork Orders\u201d to the AutoCAD, however.

Anyone remember DOS comands? Now anyone with a couple of dollars can be a GPS expert. It is interesting to discuss with local surveyors their use of GPS and how reliant they are on the software they use. Not to mention the absolute reliance they give to the information.\n\nOH I have an article the was written for the local news paper in 1986, fun to see the predictions.
