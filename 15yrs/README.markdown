# Tape Measure Scrollbar

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/JFarrow/pen/ZEXZMxK](https://codepen.io/JFarrow/pen/ZEXZMxK).

Simple tape measure scrollbar for a woodshop project I'm working on.

Might be janky on mobile at the moment. Also, scrollbars may be visible on some devices.

Tested on the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and Edge.

Demo with my [Pageable](https://github.com/Mobius1/Pageable) lib: https://codepen.io/Mobius1/pen/zbzWba which allows fast implementation.
