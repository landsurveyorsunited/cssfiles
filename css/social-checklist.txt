Social Media Checklist
We need to establish a couple of #hashtags to use over and over to track our progress..

Facebook:  On your day, immerse yourself in facebook and do the following:
           Schedule 3 or more photos to be posted during the best times displayed here: https://www.facebook.com/beautifulnationproject?sk=page_insights&section=navPosts
		   Comment or highlight on stuff other people posted to the page:  https://www.facebook.com/beautifulnationproject/allactivity?privacy_source=activity_log&log_filter=cluster_5
		   See ALL Activity on our Facebook Page here: https://www.facebook.com/beautifulnationproject/allactivity
		   Photo and Video posts get the most reaction...encourage people to share and repost..
		               When posting a photo, add the location, title of image and some description and link back to image on network.
		   
		   
Twitter:   Visit the following Twitter search engines while logged into @bnationproject [pw:l0ftninja]
           Topsy.com   Backtweets.com  Addictomatic.com	 socialmention.com	   Search for keywords related to the project (See keywords at bottom of this document)
		   Retweet, Mention or Reply to existing tweets that match, but DO NOT FOLLOW ANYONE
		   The idea is to get them to notice us and follow us.  In order to maintain our influence we must never follow more than 30% of number of people who follow us.
		   Send out tweets from pages on the site, photos, videos, articles, 
		   
Pinterest:  We need to start cross posting all of our photos to Pinterest linking back to photos on network and building boards for different locations, maps, water quality etc.
            Pinterest is basically Twitter for Images.  We should build boards that other Pinteresters will follow and repin

		   
On 3.0 Network:  Make sure you have signedup and signed into our 3.0 Network here:  http://bnation.ning.com
                 Upload several photos to the network in the /photos page or inside particular Channels (formerly Hubs)
				 All Channels have their own forum page, blog page (for articles and journals), social channel (import Youtube or Vimeo), photos and custom pages
                 

On 2.0 Network:  We will be migrating all content from 2.0 to 3.0 network shortly, but you can always just reupload your photos and discussions to 3.0 network.
                 We need to ask members to join our 3.0 or wait to migrate..need to discuss tonight.
