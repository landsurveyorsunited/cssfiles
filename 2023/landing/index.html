  <img src="https://storage.ning.com/topology/rest/1.0/file/get/12185189079?profile=RESIZE_400x" class="fl" height="250" width="250"/><p>As members of the Land Surveyors United community, we understand the importance of collaboration and networking in our industry. By actively participating in local surveying events, we not only expand our knowledge and skills but also foster meaningful connections with fellow professionals. In this article, we will explore the benefits of event participation, share tips for increasing attendance, and highlight the exciting features available on the Land Surveyors United platform.</p>
  <p>Enjoy, explore and contribute your surveying experiences to our community....a living library of land surveying which is not controlled by 3rd party interests- it is controlled by you, the surveyor. No one else in the world, aside from our community members, catalogs changes in the surveying industry. No one else focuses on collecting, curating and showcasing the importance of land surveyors to society for future generations to learn from and to promote public awareness of this importance.  We do and thank you for being a part of this effort.

It takes just a few moments per week for you to curate a rock solid legacy in surveying right from your LSU Profile, and every minute you spend sharing your experience will breathe ten years of life into the profession.  Everything you add to this community will someday outlive all of us..which is why I spend so much time doing what I can to make our network as sustainable as possible without having to rely on 3rd parties.</p>
