# Displaying a Google Street View of your current location

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/JFarrow/pen/OJyaEVQ](https://codepen.io/JFarrow/pen/OJyaEVQ).

This uses the HTML5 Geolocation API to display a Google Streetview Map of your current location. Works best on mobile devices, as they have a more accurate GPS location.

Forked from [Joshua P. Larson](http://codepen.io/jplhomer/)'s Pen [Displaying a Google Street View of your current location](http://codepen.io/jplhomer/pen/Chfie/).
