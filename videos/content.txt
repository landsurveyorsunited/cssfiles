This Hub is for Introducing yourself to your local surveyors forum in order to help us all get to know one another better.  If you're a land surveyor based in the United States, we would like to understand more about the differences and similarities between state associations, boards, laws and practices. Please join the hub forum for your state and start a discussion today! And by all means, bring this up at the next conference or chapter meeting in your state.
