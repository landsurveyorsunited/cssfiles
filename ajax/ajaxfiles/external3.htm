<p>The new Aston Martin V8 Vantage was first seen at the Geneva Motor Show in 
2005. The two seat, two door coupe has a bonded aluminium structure for strength 
and lightness. The car is powered by a 4.3 L quad-cam 32-valve V8 which produces 
380 hp (283 kW) at 7000 rpm and 302 ft·lbf (409 N·m) at 5000 rpm. This engine is 
unique to Aston Martin and features race-style dry-sump lubrication, which 
enables it to be mounted low to lower the centre of gravity. The car can 
accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.9 seconds.<p>The V8 Vantage will cost 
£79,000 or €104,000 when it goes on sale towards the end of summer 2005 and is 
intended to compete with the Porsche 911. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_V8_Vantage_(2005)">source</a>]
