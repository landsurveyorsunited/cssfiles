<p>The Ferrari Testarossa is an V12 mid-engined sports car made by Ferrari. 
  The name, which means &quot;red head&quot;, comes from the red painted cylinder heads on 
  the flat-12 engine. The engine was technically a 180° V engine since it shared 
  flat-plane crankshaft pins with opposing cylinders. Output was 390 hp (291 
  kW), and the car won many comparison tests and admirers - it was featured on 
  the cover of Road &amp; Track magazine nine times in just five years. Almost 
  10,000 Testarossas, 512TRs, and 512Ms were produced, making this one of the 
  most common Ferrari models despite its high price and exotic design. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_Testarossa#Testarossa">source</a>]
